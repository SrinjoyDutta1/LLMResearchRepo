There's lots to be done. The ideal solution would be to import into an UNLOGGED table without indexes, then change it to logged and add the indexes. Unfortunately in PostgreSQL 9.4 there's no support for changing tables from UNLOGGED to logged. 9.5 adds ALTER TABLE ... SET LOGGED to permit you to do this.
If you can take your database offline for the bulk import, use pg_bulkload.
Otherwise:

Disable any triggers on the table
Drop indexes before starting the import, re-create them afterwards. (It takes much less time to build an index in one pass than it does to add the same data to it progressively, and the resulting index is much more compact).
If doing the import within a single transaction, it's safe to drop foreign key constraints, do the import, and re-create the constraints before committing. Do not do this if the import is split across multiple transactions as you might introduce invalid data.
If possible, use COPY instead of INSERTs
If you can't use COPY consider using multi-valued INSERTs if practical. You seem to be doing this already. Don't try to list too many values in a single VALUES though; those values have to fit in memory a couple of times over, so keep it to a few hundred per statement.
Batch your inserts into explicit transactions, doing hundreds of thousands or millions of inserts per transaction. There's no practical limit AFAIK, but batching will let you recover from an error by marking the start of each batch in your input data. Again, you seem to be doing this already.
Use synchronous_commit=off and a huge commit_delay to reduce fsync() costs. This won't help much if you've batched your work into big transactions, though.
INSERT or COPY in parallel from several connections. How many depends on your hardware's disk subsystem; as a rule of thumb, you want one connection per physical hard drive if using direct attached storage.
Set a high checkpoint_segments value and enable log_checkpoints. Look at the PostgreSQL logs and make sure it's not complaining about checkpoints occurring too frequently.
If and only if you don't mind losing your entire PostgreSQL cluster (your database and any others on the same cluster) to catastrophic corruption if the system crashes during the import, you can stop Pg, set fsync=off, start Pg, do your import, then (vitally) stop Pg and set fsync=on again. See WAL configuration. Do not do this if there is already any data you care about in any database on your PostgreSQL install. If you set fsync=off you can also set full_page_writes=off; again, just remember to turn it back on after your import to prevent database corruption and data loss. See non-durable settings in the Pg manual.

You should also look at tuning your system:

Use good quality SSDs for storage as much as possible. Good SSDs with reliable, power-protected write-back caches make commit rates incredibly faster. They're less beneficial when you follow the advice above - which reduces disk flushes / number of fsync()s - but can still be a big help. Do not use cheap SSDs without proper power-failure protection unless you don't care about keeping your data.
If you're using RAID 5 or RAID 6 for direct attached storage, stop now. Back your data up, restructure your RAID array to RAID 10, and try again. RAID 5/6 are hopeless for bulk write performance - though a good RAID controller with a big cache can help.
If you have the option of using a hardware RAID controller with a big battery-backed write-back cache this can really improve write performance for workloads with lots of commits. It doesn't help as much if you're using async commit with a commit_delay or if you're doing fewer big transactions during bulk loading.
If possible, store WAL (pg_xlog) on a separate disk / disk array. There's little point in using a separate filesystem on the same disk. People often choose to use a RAID1 pair for WAL. Again, this has more effect on systems with high commit rates, and it has little effect if you're using an unlogged table as the data load target.

When scrolling to the right or left, the SwipeRefreshLayout view caches the touch, prevents the HorizontalScrollView from receiving it and starts scrolling vertically to perform the refresh.
I tried solving this issue as I previously solved issues with vertical ScrollView with ViewPager inside, using requestDisallowInterceptTouchEvent but it didn't work. I also noticed that this method is overridden in the original SwipeRefreshLayout class without returning the super. Google's developer left a comment instead ""//Nope."" :)
Because SwipeRefreshLayout component is relatively new, I couldn't find a solution that fixes the horizontal scroll issue while still allowing the swipe to refresh view to track and handle vertical scrolling so I thought I'll share my solution with hopes it will spare someone an hour or two.

* A few comments have been raised that my original answer was not correct.  It worked if alpha values were inverted from the normal.  By definition, however, this won't work in most cases.  I've therefore updated the formula below to be correct for the normal case.  This ends up being equal to @hkurabko's answer below *
A more specific answer, however, incorporates the alpha value into the actual colour result based on an opaque background colour (or 'matte' as it's referred to).
There is an algorithm for this (from this wikipedia link):

Normalise the RGBA values so that they're all between 0 and 1 - just divide each value by 255 to do this.  We'll call the result Source.
Normalise also the matte colour (black, white whatever).  We'll call the result BGColor Note - if the background colour is also transparent, then you'll have to recurse the process for that first (again, choosing a matte) to get the source RGB for this operation.
Now, the conversion is defined as (in complete psuedo code here!):
Source => Target = (BGColor + Source) =
Target.R = ((1 - Source.A) * BGColor.R) + (Source.A * Source.R)
Target.G = ((1 - Source.A) * BGColor.G) + (Source.A * Source.G)
Target.B = ((1 - Source.A) * BGColor.B) + (Source.A * Source.B)


To get the final 0-255 values for Target you simply multiply all the normalised values back up by 255, making sure you cap at 255 if any of the combined values exceed 1.0 (this is over-exposure and there are more complex algorithms dealing with this that involve whole-image processing etc.).
EDIT: In your question you said you want a white background - in that case just fix BGColor to 255,255,255.

This forces the user to scan the tab bar first to see if the file is currently opened; if it's not opened then you can look to the project tree.  But if you click in the project tree first (which is what I tend to do) then you get punished because you will have just killed a tab.

A lazy programmer most often finds ways to decrease the amount of time spent writing code (especially a lot of similar or repeating code). This often translates into tools and workflows that other developers in the company/team can benefit from.
As the developer encounters similar projects he may create tools to bootstrap the development process (e.g. creating a DRM layer that works with the company's database design paradigms).
Furthermore, developers such as these often use some form of code generation. This means all bugs of the same type (for example, the code generator did not check for null parameters on all methods) can often be fixed by fixing the generator and not the 50+ instances of that bug.
A lazy programmer may take a few more hours to get the first product out the door, but will save you months down the line.

36640426,14860.0,2016-04-15 07:08:00+00:00,36640260,53,"How it works is largely irrelevant - as a developer working at a certain level (ie, coding to the UNIX APIs), you really only need to know that it works.
Having said that however, and recognising that curiosity or a need to understand at some depth is generally a good trait to have, there are any number of ways that this could be done.
First off, your contention that a function can only return one value is correct as far as it goes but you need to remember that, after the process split, there are actually two instances of the function running, one in each process. They're mostly independent of each other and can follow different code paths. The following diagram may help in understanding this:
Process 314159 | Process 271828
-------------- | --------------
runs for a bit |
calls fork     |
               | comes into existence
returns 271828 | returns 0

You can hopefully see there that a single instance of fork can only return one value (as per any other C function) but there are actually multiple instances running, which is why it's said to return multiple values in the documentation.

Here's one possibility on how it could work.
When the fork() function starts running, it stores the current process ID (PID).
Then, when it comes time to return, if the PID is the same as that stored, it's the parent. Otherwise it's the child. Pseudo-code follows:
def fork():
    saved_pid = getpid()

    # Magic here, returns PID of other process or -1 on failure.

    other_pid = split_proc_into_two();

    if other_pid == -1:        # fork failed -> return -1
        return -1

    if saved_pid == getpid():  # pid same, parent -> return child PID
        return other_pid

    return 0                   # pid changed, child, return zero

Note that there's a lot of magic in the split_proc_into_two() call and it almost certainly won't work that way at all under the covers(a). It's just to illustrate the concepts around it, which is basically:

get the original PID before the split, which will remain identical for both processes after they split.
do the split.
get the current PID after the split, which will be different in the two processes.

You may also want to take a look at this answer, it explains the fork/exec philosophy.

(a) It's almost certainly more complex than I've explained. For example, in MINIX, the call to fork ends up running in the kernel, which has access to the entire process tree.
It simply copies the parent process structure into a free slot for the child, along the lines of:
sptr = (char *) proc_addr (k1); // parent pointer
chld = (char *) proc_addr (k2); // child pointer
dptr = chld;
bytes = sizeof (struct proc);   // bytes to copy
while (bytes--)                 // copy the structure
    *dptr++ = *sptr++;

Then it makes slight modifications to the child structure to ensure it will be suitable, including the line:
chld->p_reg[RET_REG] = 0;       // make sure child receives zero

So, basically identical to the scheme I posited, but using data modifications rather than code path selection to decide what to return to the caller - in other words, you'd see something like:
return rpc->p_reg[RET_REG];

at the end of fork() so that the correct value gets returned depending on whether it's the parent or child process.
",36640260,5826291.0,2016-04-15 07:00:09+00:00,,47,How does fork() know when to return 0?,"Take the following example:
int main(void)
{
     pid_t  pid;

     pid = fork();
     if (pid == 0) 
          ChildProcess();
     else 
          ParentProcess();
}

So correct me if I am wrong, once fork() executes a child process is created. Now going by this answer fork() returns twice. That is once for the parent process and once for the child process. 
Which means that two separate processes come into existence DURING the fork call and not after it ending. 
Now I don't get it how it understands how to return 0 for the child process and the correct PID for the parent process. 
This where it gets really confusing. This answer states that fork() works by copying the context information of the process and manually setting the return value to 0. 
First am I right in saying that the return to any function is placed in a single register? Since in a single processor environment a process can call only one subroutine that returns only one value (correct me if I am wrong here). 
Let's say I call a function foo() inside a routine and that function returns a value, that value will be stored in a register say BAR. Each time a function wants to return a value it will use a particular processor register. So if I am able to manually change the return value in the process block I am able to change the value returned to the function right?
So am I correct in thinking that is how fork() works?

It was a lot easier about 10 years ago than it is now, but if you have a phenomenal amount of time, money and patience available, it is still possible.
You will need to contact an acquiring bank.  You didnt say what region of the world you are in, but by this I dont mean a local bank branch. Each major bank will generally have a separate card acquiring arm. So here in the UK we have (eg) Natwest bank, which uses Streamline (or Worldpay) as its acquiring arm. In total even though we have scores of major banks, they all end up using one of five or so card acquirers.
Happily, all UK card acquirers use a standard protocol for communication of authorisation requests, and end of day settlement.  You will find minor quirks where some acquiring banks support some features and have slightly different syntax, but the differences are fairly minor. The UK standards are published by the Association for Payment Clearing Services (APACS) (which is now known as the UKPA). The standards are still commonly referred to as APACS 30 (authorization) and APACS 29 (settlement), but are now formally known as APACS 70 (books 1 through 7). 
Although the APACS standard is widely supported across the UK (Amex and Discover accept messages in this format too) it is not used in other countries - each country has it's own - for example: Carte Bancaire in France, CartaSi in Italy, Sistema 4B in Spain, Dankort in Denmark etc. An effort is under way to unify the protocols across Europe - see EPAS.org 
Communicating with the acquiring bank can be done a number of ways. Again though, it will depend on your region. In the UK (and most of Europe) we have one communications gateway that provides connectivity to all the major acquirers, they are called TNS and there are dozens of ways of communicating through them to the acquiring bank, from dialup 9600 baud modems, ISDN, HTTPS, VPN or dedicated line.  Ultimately the authorisation request will be converted to X25 protocol, which is the protocol used by these acquiring banks when communicating with each other.
In summary then: it all depends on your region.

Contact a major bank and try to get through to their card acquiring arm.
Explain that you're setting up as a payment service provider, and request details on comms format for authorization requests and end of day settlement files
Set up a test merchant account and develop auth/settlement software and go through the accreditation process. Most acquirers help you through this process for free, but when you want to register as an accredited PSP some will request a fee.
you will need to comply with some regulations too, for example you may need to register as a payment institution

Once you are registered and accredited you'll then be able to accept customers and set up merchant accounts on behalf of the bank/s you're accredited against (bearing in mind that each acquirer will generally support multiple banks).  Rinse and repeat with other acquirers as you see necessary.
Beyond that you have lots of other issues, mainly dealing with PCI-DSS. Thats a whole other topic and there are already some q&a's on this site regarding that. Like I say, its a phenomenal undertaking - most likely a multi-year project even for a reasonably sized team, but its certainly possible.

Disclaimer: I may not always use the right terms when describing patterns or techniques. Sorry for that.
The Goals:

Create a complete example of a basic controller for viewing and editing Users.
All code must be fully testable and mockable.
The controller should have no idea where the data is stored (meaning it can be changed).
Example to show a SQL implementation (most common).
For maximum performance, controllers should only receive the data they needâno extra fields.
Implementation should leverage some type of data mapper for ease of development.
Implementation should have the ability to perform complex data lookups.

The Solution
I'm splitting my persistent storage (database) interaction into two categories: R (Read) and CUD (Create, Update, Delete). My experience has been that reads are really what causes an application to slow down. And while data manipulation (CUD) is actually slower, it happens much less frequently, and is therefore much less of a concern.
CUD (Create, Update, Delete) is easy. This will involve working with actual models, which are then passed to my Repositories for persistence. Note, my repositories will still provide a Read method, but simply for object creation, not display. More on that later.
R (Read) is not so easy. No models here, just value objects. Use arrays if you prefer. These objects may represent a single model or a blend of many models, anything really. These are not very interesting on their own, but how they are generated is. I'm using what I'm calling Query Objects.
The Code:
User Model
Let's start simple with our basic user model. Note that there is no ORM extending or database stuff at all. Just pure model glory. Add your getters, setters, validation, whatever.
class User
{
    public $id;
    public $first_name;
    public $last_name;
    public $gender;
    public $email;
    public $password;
}

Repository Interface
Before I create my user repository, I want to create my repository interface. This will define the ""contract"" that repositories must follow in order to be used by my controller. Remember, my controller will not know where the data is actually stored.
Note that my repositories will only every contain these three methods. The save() method is responsible for both creating and updating users, simply depending on whether or not the user object has an id set.
interface UserRepositoryInterface
{
    public function find($id);
    public function save(User $user);
    public function remove(User $user);
}

SQL Repository Implementation
Now to create my implementation of the interface. As mentioned, my example was going to be with an SQL database. Note the use of a data mapper to prevent having to write repetitive SQL queries.
class SQLUserRepository implements UserRepositoryInterface
{
    protected $db;

    public function __construct(Database $db)
    {
        $this->db = $db;
    }

    public function find($id)
    {
        // Find a record with the id = $id
        // from the 'users' table
        // and return it as a User object
        return $this->db->find($id, 'users', 'User');
    }

    public function save(User $user)
    {
        // Insert or update the $user
        // in the 'users' table
        $this->db->save($user, 'users');
    }

    public function remove(User $user)
    {
        // Remove the $user
        // from the 'users' table
        $this->db->remove($user, 'users');
    }
}

Query Object Interface
Now with CUD (Create, Update, Delete) taken care of by our repository, we can focus on the R (Read). Query objects are simply an encapsulation of some type of data lookup logic. They are not query builders. By abstracting it like our repository we can change it's implementation and test it easier. An example of a Query Object might be an AllUsersQuery or AllActiveUsersQuery, or even MostCommonUserFirstNames.
You may be thinking ""can't I just create methods in my repositories for those queries?"" Yes, but here is why I'm not doing this:

My repositories are meant for working with model objects. In a real world app, why would I ever need to get the password field if I'm looking to list all my users?
Repositories are often model specific, yet queries often involve more than one model. So what repository do you put your method in?
This keeps my repositories very simpleânot an bloated class of methods.
All queries are now organized into their own classes.
Really, at this point, repositories exist simply to abstract my database layer.

For my example I'll create a query object to lookup ""AllUsers"". Here is the interface:
interface AllUsersQueryInterface
{
    public function fetch($fields);
}

Query Object Implementation
This is where we can use a data mapper again to help speed up development. Notice that I am allowing one tweak to the returned datasetâthe fields. This is about as far as I want to go with manipulating the performed query. Remember, my query objects are not query builders. They simply perform a specific query. However, since I know that I'll probably be using this one a lot, in a number of different situations, I'm giving myself the ability to specify the fields. I never want to return fields I don't need!
class AllUsersQuery implements AllUsersQueryInterface
{
    protected $db;

    public function __construct(Database $db)
    {
        $this->db = $db;
    }

    public function fetch($fields)
    {
        return $this->db->select($fields)->from('users')->orderBy('last_name, first_name')->rows();
    }
}

Before moving on to the controller, I want to show another example to illustrate how powerful this is. Maybe I have a reporting engine and need to create a report for AllOverdueAccounts. This could be tricky with my data mapper, and I may want to write some actual SQL in this situation. No problem, here is what this query object could look like:
class AllOverdueAccountsQuery implements AllOverdueAccountsQueryInterface
{
    protected $db;

    public function __construct(Database $db)
    {
        $this->db = $db;
    }

    public function fetch()
    {
        return $this->db->query($this->sql())->rows();
    }

    public function sql()
    {
        return ""SELECT..."";
    }
}

This nicely keeps all my logic for this report in one class, and it's easy to test. I can mock it to my hearts content, or even use a different implementation entirely.
The Controller
Now the fun partâbringing all the pieces together. Note that I am using dependency injection. Typically dependencies are injected into the constructor, but I actually prefer to inject them right into my controller methods (routes). This minimizes the controller's object graph, and I actually find it more legible. Note, if you don't like this approach, just use the traditional constructor method.
class UsersController
{
    public function index(AllUsersQueryInterface $query)
    {
        // Fetch user data
        $users = $query->fetch(['first_name', 'last_name', 'email']);

        // Return view
        return Response::view('all_users.php', ['users' => $users]);
    }

    public function add()
    {
        return Response::view('add_user.php');
    }

    public function insert(UserRepositoryInterface $repository)
    {
        // Create new user model
        $user = new User;
        $user->first_name = $_POST['first_name'];
        $user->last_name = $_POST['last_name'];
        $user->gender = $_POST['gender'];
        $user->email = $_POST['email'];

        // Save the new user
        $repository->save($user);

        // Return the id
        return Response::json(['id' => $user->id]);
    }

    public function view(SpecificUserQueryInterface $query, $id)
    {
        // Load user data
        if (!$user = $query->fetch($id, ['first_name', 'last_name', 'gender', 'email'])) {
            return Response::notFound();
        }

        // Return view
        return Response::view('view_user.php', ['user' => $user]);
    }

    public function edit(SpecificUserQueryInterface $query, $id)
    {
        // Load user data
        if (!$user = $query->fetch($id, ['first_name', 'last_name', 'gender', 'email'])) {
            return Response::notFound();
        }

        // Return view
        return Response::view('edit_user.php', ['user' => $user]);
    }

    public function update(UserRepositoryInterface $repository)
    {
        // Load user model
        if (!$user = $repository->find($id)) {
            return Response::notFound();
        }

        // Update the user
        $user->first_name = $_POST['first_name'];
        $user->last_name = $_POST['last_name'];
        $user->gender = $_POST['gender'];
        $user->email = $_POST['email'];

        // Save the user
        $repository->save($user);

        // Return success
        return true;
    }

    public function delete(UserRepositoryInterface $repository)
    {
        // Load user model
        if (!$user = $repository->find($id)) {
            return Response::notFound();
        }

        // Delete the user
        $repository->delete($user);

        // Return success
        return true;
    }
}

Final Thoughts:
The important things to note here are that when I'm modifying (creating, updating or deleting) entities, I'm working with real model objects, and performing the persistance through my repositories.
However, when I'm displaying (selecting data and sending it to the views) I'm not working with model objects, but rather plain old value objects. I only select the fields I need, and it's designed so I can maximum my data lookup performance.
My repositories stay very clean, and instead this ""mess"" is organized into my model queries.
I use a data mapper to help with development, as it's just ridiculous to write repetitive SQL for common tasks. However, you absolutely can write SQL where needed (complicated queries, reporting, etc.). And when you do, it's nicely tucked away into a properly named class.
I'd love to hear your take on my approach!

July 2015 Update:
I've been asked in the comments where I ended up with all this. Well, not that far off actually. Truthfully, I still don't really like repositories. I find them overkill for basic lookups (especially if you're already using an ORM), and messy when working with more complicated queries.
I generally work with an ActiveRecord style ORM, so most often I'll just reference those models directly throughout my application. However, in situations where I have more complex queries, I'll use query objects to make these more reusable. I should also note that I always inject my models into my methods, making them easier to mock in my tests.
",16176990,297015.0,2013-04-23 18:50:05+00:00,,148,Proper Repository Pattern Design in PHP?,"Preface: I'm attemping to use the repository pattern in a MVC architecture with relational databases.
I've recently started learning TDD in PHP, and I'm realizing that my database is coupled much too closely with the rest of my application. I've read about repositories, and using an IoC container to ""inject"" it into my controllers. Very cool stuff. But now have some practical questions about repository design. Consider the follow example.
<?php

class DbUserRepository implements UserRepositoryInterface
{
    protected $db;

    public function __construct($db)
    {
        $this->db = $db;
    }

    public function findAll()
    {
    }

    public function findById($id)
    {
    }

    public function findByName($name)
    {
    }

    public function create($user)
    {
    }

    public function remove($user)
    {
    }

    public function update($user)
    {
    }
}

Issue #1: Too many fields
All of these find methods use a select all fields (SELECT *) approach. However, in my apps I'm always trying to limit the number of fields I get, as this often adds overhead and slows things down. For those using this pattern, how do you deal with this?
Issue #2: Too many methods
While this class looks nice right now, I know that in a real world app I need a lot more methods. For example:

findAllByNameAndStatus
findAllInCountry
findAllWithEmailAddressSet
findAllByAgeAndGender
findAllByAgeAndGenderOrderByAge
Etc.

As you can see, there could be very, very long list of possible methods. And then if you add in the field selection issue above, the problem worsens. In the past I'd normally just put all this logic right in my controller:
<?php

class MyController
{
    public function users()
    {
        $users = User::select('name, email, status')->byCountry('Canada')->orderBy('name')->rows()

        return View::make('users', array('users' => $users))
    }

}

With my repository approach, I don't want to end up with this:
<?php

class MyController
{
    public function users()
    {
        $users = $this->repo->get_first_name_last_name_email_username_status_by_country_order_by_name('Canada');

        return View::make('users', array('users' => $users))
    }

}

Issue #3: Impossible to match an interface
I see the benefit in using interfaces for repositories, so I can swap out my implementation (for testing purposes or other). My understanding of interfaces is that they define a contract that an implementation must follow. This is great until you start adding additional methods to your repositories like findAllInCountry(). Now I need to update my interface to also have this method, otherwise other implementations may not have it, and that could break my application. By this feels insane...a case of the tail wagging the dog.
Specification Pattern?
This leads me to believe that repository should only have a fixed number of methods (like save(), remove(), find(), findAll(), etc). But then how do I run specific lookups? I've heard of the Specification Pattern, but it seems to me that this only reduces an entire set of records (via IsSatisfiedBy()), which clearly has major performance issues if you're pulling from a database.
Help?
Clearly I need to rethink things a little when working with repositories. Can anyone enlighten on how this is best handled?

13443183,414058.0,2012-11-18 18:29:15+00:00,2213030,118,"The Frame Buffer object is not actually a buffer, but an aggregator object that contains one or more attachments, which by their turn, are the actual buffers. You can understand the Frame Buffer as C structure where every member is a pointer to a buffer. Without any attachment, a Frame Buffer object has very low footprint.
Now each buffer attached to a Frame Buffer can be a Render Buffer or a texture.
The Render Buffer is an actual buffer (an array of bytes, or integers, or pixels). The Render Buffer stores pixel values in native format, so it's optimized for offscreen rendering. In other words, drawing to a Render Buffer can be much faster than drawing to a texture. The drawback is that pixels uses a native, implementation-dependent format, so that reading from a Render Buffer is much harder than reading from a texture. Nevertheless, once a Render Buffer has been painted, one can copy its content directly to screen (or to other Render Buffer, I guess), very quickly using pixel transfer operations. This means that a Render Buffer can be used to efficiently implement the double buffer pattern that you mentioned.
Render Buffers are a relatively new concept. Before them, a Frame Buffer was used to render to a texture, which can be slower because a texture uses a standard format. It is still possible to render to a texture, and that's quite useful when one needs to perform multiple passes over each pixel to build a scene, or to draw a scene on a surface of another scene!

Original question
I've looked through several posts on StackOverflow, but haven't been able to find an answer to this rather simple question.
I have an HTML construct like this:
<table>
  <tr>
    <td class=""thatSetsABackground"">
      <div class=""thatSetsABackgroundWithAnIcon"">
        <dl>
          <dt>yada

        </dl>
      <div>
    </td>

What I need is for the div to fill the height of the td, so I can be able to position the div's background (the icon) at the bottom-right corner of the td.
How do you suggest I go about that?

271842,13552.0,2008-11-07 11:45:24+00:00,271710,165,"To answer the ""why"" part of the question as to why not List<T>, The reasons are future-proofing and API simplicity.
Future-proofing
List<T> is not designed to be easily extensible by subclassing it; it is designed to be fast for internal implementations. You'll notice the methods on it are not virtual and so cannot be overridden, and there are no hooks into its Add/Insert/Remove operations. 
This means that if you need to alter the behaviour of the collection in the future (e.g. to reject null objects that people try to add, or to perform additional work when this happens such as updating your class state) then you need to change the type of collection you return to one you can subclass, which will be a breaking interface change (of course changing the semantics of things like not allowing null may also be an interface change, but things like updating your internal class state would not be).
So by returning either a class that can be easily subclassed such as Collection<T> or an interface such as IList<T>, ICollection<T> or IEnumerable<T> you can change your internal implementation to be a different collection type to meet your needs, without breaking the code of consumers because it can still be returned as the type they are expecting.
API Simplicity
List<T> contains a lot of useful operations such as BinarySearch, Sort and so on. However if this is a collection you are exposing then it is likely that you control the semantics of the list, and not the consumers. So while your class internally may need these operations it is very unlikely that consumers of your class would want to (or even should) call them.
As such, by offering a simpler collection class or interface, you reduce the number of members that users of your API see, and make it easier for them to use.

Seriously.
Look at the things that are important: your project, your code, your job, your personal life. None of them are going to have their success rest on whether or not you use the ""this"" keyword to qualify access to fields. The this keyword will not help you ship on time. It's not going to reduce bugs, it's not going to have any appreciable effect on code quality or maintainability. It's not going to get you a raise, or allow you to spend less time at the office. 
It's really just a style issue. If you like ""this"", then use it. If you don't, then don't. If you need it to get correct semantics then use it. The truth is, every programmer has his own unique programing style. That style reflects that particular programmer's notions of what the ""most aesthetically pleasing code"" should look like. By definition, any other programmer who reads your code is going to have a different programing style. That means there is always going to be something you did that the other guy doesn't like, or would have done differently. At some point some guy is going to read your code and grumble about something. 
I wouldn't fret over it. I would just make sure the code is as aesthetically pleasing as possible according to your own tastes. If you ask 10 programmers how to format code, you are going to get about 15 different opinions. A better thing to focus on is how the code is factored. Are things abstracted right? Did I pick meaningful names for things? Is there a lot of code duplication? Are there ways I can simplify stuff? Getting those things right, I think, will have the greatest positive impact on your project, your code, your job, and your life. Coincidentally, it will probably also cause the other guy to grumble the least. If your code works, is easy to read, and is well factored, the other guy isn't going to be scrutinizing how you initialize fields. He's just going to use your code, marvel at it's greatness, and then move on to something else.

Incidentially, this either implies that your RPM (resp. DPkg/DSelect) database is corrupted, or that the application you're trying to run wasn't installed through the package manager.

Anyone needing to install glibc.i686 or glibc.i386 will probably run into other library dependencies, as well. To identify a package providing an arbitrary library, you can use
 ldd /usr/bin/YOURAPPHERE

if you're not sure it's in /usr/bin you can also fall back on
 ldd $(which YOURAPPNAME)

Look over the output for missing libraries, and for each one, take its name (e.g. for libSM.so.6 => missing you would use libSM.so.6) and run:
Fedora/Red Hat Enterprise/CentOS:
 dnf provides /usr/lib/libSM.so.6

or, on older RHEL/CentOS:
 yum provides /usr/lib/libSM.so.6

or, on Debian/Ubuntu:
first, install and download the database for apt-file
 sudo apt-get install apt-file && apt-file update

then search with
 apt-file find libSM.so.6

Note the prefix path /usr/lib in the (usual) case; rarely, some libraries still live under /lib for historical reasons â¦ On typical 64-bit systems, 32-bit libraries live in /usr/lib and 64-bit libraries live in /usr/lib64.
(Debian/Ubuntu organise multi-architecture libraries differently.)
This should give you a package name, e.g.:
libSM-1.2.0-2.fc15.i686 : X.Org X11 SM runtime library
Repo        : fedora
Matched from:
Filename    : /usr/lib/libSM.so.6

You can then pkcon install libSM.i686 (or specify the version fully: sudo dnf install ibSM-1.2.0-2.fc15.i686) to grab the requisite library. (Using pkcon in a GUI, or sudo dnf/yum/apt-get as appropriateâ¦)
Some libraries will have an âepochâ designator before their name; this can be omitted, it's an artefact of the way that the underlying RPM libraries handle version numbers; e.g. 
2:libpng-1.2.46-1.fc16.i686 : A library of functions for manipulating PNG image format files
Repo        : fedora
Matched from:
Filename    : /usr/lib/libpng.so.3

Here, the 2: can be omitted; just pkcon install libpng.i686 or sudo dnf install libpng-1.2.46-1.fc16.i686. (It vaguely implies something like: at some point, the version number of the libpng package rolled backwards, and the âepochâ had to be incremented to make sure the newer version would be considered ânewerâ during updates. Or something similar happened. Twice.)

The reasoning is a bit analogous to the sealed argument for classes, put forward by Jon. One entity in a program should have one job, and one job only. In particular, it makes absolutely no sense for most variables and properties to ever change value. There are basically two exceptions.

Loop variables. But then, I argue that the variable actually doesn't change value at all. Rather, it goes out of scope at the end of the loop and is re-instantiated in the next turn. Therefore, immutability would work nicely with loop variables and everyone who tries to change a loop variable's value by hand should go straight to hell.
Accumulators. For example, imagine the case of summing over the values in an array, or even a list/string that accumulates some information about something else.
Today, there are better means to accomplish the same goal. Functional languages have higher-order functions, Python has list comprehension and .NET has LINQ. In all these cases, there is no need for a mutable accumulator / result holder.
Consider the special case of string concatenation. In many environments (.NET, Java), strings are actually immutables. Why then allow an assignment to a string variable at all? Much better to use a builder class (i.e. a StringBuilder) all along.

I realize that most languages today just aren't built to acquiesce in my wish. In my opinion, all these languages are fundamentally flawed for this reason. They would lose nothing of their expressiveness, power, and ease of use if they would be changed to treat all variables as read-only by default and didn't allow any assignment to them after their initialization.

I contended that classes in C# should be sealed by default - I won't put my reasoning in the question, but I might write a fuller explanation as an answer to this question. I was surprised at the heat of the discussion in the comments (25 comments currently).
So, what contentious opinions do you hold? I'd rather avoid the kind of thing which ends up being pretty religious with relatively little basis (e.g. brace placing) but examples might include things like ""unit testing isn't actually terribly helpful"" or ""public fields are okay really"".

Lazy evaluation makes macros redundant

This is pure nonsense (not your fault; I've heard it before). It's true that you can use macros to change the order, context, etc. of expression evaluation, but that's the most basic use of macros, and it's really not convenient to simulate a lazy language using ad-hoc macros instead of functions. So if you came at macros from that direction, you would indeed be disappointed.
Macros are for extending the language with new syntactic forms. Some of the specific capabilities of macros are

Affecting the order, context, etc. of expression evaluation.
Creating new binding forms (i.e. affecting the scope an expression is evaluated in).
Performing compile-time computation, including code analysis and transformation.

Macros that do (1) can be pretty simple. For example, in Racket, the exception-handling form, with-handlers, is just a macro that expands into call-with-exception-handler, some conditionals, and some continuation code. It's used like this:
(with-handlers ([(lambda (e) (exn:fail:network? e))
                 (lambda (e)
                   (printf ""network seems to be broken\n"")
                   (cleanup))])
  (do-some-network-stuff))

The macro implements the notion of ""predicate-and-handler clauses in the dynamic context of the exception"" based on the primitive call-with-exception-handler which handles all exceptions at the point they're raised.
A more sophisticated use of macros is an implementation of an LALR(1) parser generator. Instead of a separate file that needs pre-processing, the parser form is just another kind of expression. It takes a grammar description, computes the tables at compile time, and produces a parser function. The action routines are lexically-scoped, so they can refer to other definitions in the file or even lambda-bound variables. You can even use other language extensions in the action routines.
At the extreme end, Typed Racket is a typed dialect of Racket implemented via macros. It has a sophisticated type system designed to match the idioms of Racket/Scheme code, and it interoperates with untyped modules by protecting typed functions with dynamic software contracts (also implemented via macros). It's implemented by a ""typed module"" macro that expands, type-checks, and transforms the module body as well as auxiliary macros for attaching type information to definitions, etc.
FWIW, there's also Lazy Racket, a lazy dialect of Racket. It's not implemented by turning every function into a macro, but by rebinding lambda, define, and the function application syntax to macros that create and force promises.
In summary, lazy evaluation and macros have a small point of intersection, but they're extremely different things. And macros are certainly not subsumed by lazy evaluation.
",7046950,499560.0,2011-08-12 22:24:12+00:00,,42,Lazy Evaluation vs Macros,"I'm used to lazy evaluation from Haskell, and find myself getting irritated with eager-by-default languages now that I've used lazy evaluation properly. This is actually quite damaging, as the other languages I use mainly make lazily evaluating stuff very awkward, normally involving the rolling out of custom iterators and so forth. So just by acquiring some knowledge, I've actually made myself less productive in my original languages. Sigh.
But I hear that AST macros offer another clean way of doing the same thing. I've often heard statements like 'Lazy evaluation makes macros redundant' and vice-versa, mostly from sparring Lisp and Haskell communities.
I've dabbled with macros in various Lisp variants. They just seemed like a really organized way of copy and pasting chunks of code around to be handled at compile time. They certainly weren't the holy grail that Lispers like to think it is. But that's almost certainly because I can't use them properly. Of course, having the macro system work on the same core data structure that the language itself is assembled with is really useful, but it's still basically an organized way of copy-and-pasting code around. I acknowledge that basing a macro system on the same AST as the language that allows full runtime alteration is powerful.
What I want to know is, is how can macros be used to concisely and succinctly do what lazy-evaluation does? If I want to process a file line by line without slurping up the whole thing, I just return a list that's had a line-reading routine mapped over it. It's the perfect example of DWIM (do what I mean). I don't even have to think about it.
I clearly don't get macros. I've used them and not been particularly impressed given the hype. So there's something I'm missing that I'm not getting by reading over documentation online. Can someone explain all of this to me?

One interesting option is to store the booleans in a byte, do a right shift and compare with the original byte.

2672411,53212.0,2010-04-20 03:51:05+00:00,2672380,461,"All arrays in Javascript contain array.length elements, starting with array[0] up until array[array.length - 1].  By definition, an array element with index i is said to be part of the array if i is between 0 and array.length - 1 inclusive.
That is, arrays in Javascript are linear, starting with zero and going to a maximum, and arrays don't have a mechanism for excluding certain values or ranges from the array.  Therefore, to find out if a value exists at a given position index (where index is 0 or a positive integer), you literally just use
if (index < array.length) {
  // do stuff
}

However, it is possible for some array values to be null, undefined, NaN, Infinity, 0, or a whole host of different values.  For example, if you add array values by increasing the array.length property, any new values will be undefined.  From the question, I suspect you want to know not if a given value is considered part of the array, but whether that value is something meaningful, or has been defined.  That is, not ""undefined"", or perhaps, not ""undefined or null"".
if (typeof array[index] !== 'undefined') {

or
if (typeof array[index] !== 'undefined' && array[index] !== null) {

It depends on what you're trying to achieve.
Interestingly, because of Javascript's comparison rules, my last example can be optimised down to:
if (array[index] != null) {

24785777,247696.0,2014-07-16 16:18:08+00:00,16408300,66,"Here's the long answer.
Remotes:
If you're using Git collaboratively, you'll probably need to sync your commits with other machines or locations. Each machine or location is called a remote, in Git's terminology, and each one may have one or more brances. Most often, you'll just have one, named origin. To list all the remotes, run git remote:
$ git remote
bitbucket
origin

You can see which locations these remote names are shortcuts for, by running git remote -v:
$ git remote -v
bitbucket git@bitbucket.org:flimm/example.git (fetch)
bitbucket git@bitbucket.org:flimm/example.git (push)
origin git@github.com:Flimm/example.git (fetch)
origin git@github.com:Flimm/example.git (push)

Each remote has a directory under git/refs/remotes/:
$ ls -F .git/refs/remotes/
bitbucket/ origin/

Branches on your machine:
TLDR: on your local machine, you've got three types of branches: local non-tracking branches, local tracking branches, and remote-tracking branches. On a remote machine, you've just got one type of branch.
1. Local branches
You can view a list of all the local branches on your machine by running git branch:
$ git branch
master
new-feature

Each local branch has a file under .git/refs/heads/:
$ ls -F .git/refs/heads/
master new-feature

There are two types of local branches on your machine: non-tracking local branches, and tracking local branches.
1.1 Non-tracking local branches
Non-tracking local branches are not associated with any other branch. You create one by running git branch <branchname>.
1.2. Tracking local branches
Tracking local branches are associated with another branch, usually a remote-tracking branch. You create one by running git branch --track <branchname> [<start-point>].
You can view which one of your local branches are tracking branches using git branch -vv:
$ git branch -vv
master      b31f87c85 [origin/master] Example commit message
new-feature b760e04ed Another example commit message

From this command's output, you can see that the local branch master is tracking the remote-tracking branch origin/master, and the local branch new-feature is not tracking anything.
Another way to see which branches are tracking branches is by having a look at .git/config.
Tracking local branches are useful. They allow you to run git pull and git push, without specifying which upstream branch to use. If the branch is not set up to track another branch, you'll get an error like this one:
$ git checkout new-feature
$ git pull
There is no tracking information for the current branch.
Please specify which branch you want to merge with.
See git-pull(1) for details

    git pull <remote> <branch>

If you wish to set tracking information for this branch you can do so with:

    git branch --set-upstream new-feature <remote>/<branch>

2. Remote-tracking branches (still on your machine)
You can view a list of all the remote-tracking branches on your machine by running git branch -r:
$ git branch -r
bitbucket/master
origin/master
origin/new-branch

Each remote-tracking branch has a file under .git/refs/<remote>/:
$ tree -F .git/refs/remotes/
.git/refs/remotes/
âââ bitbucket/
âÂ Â  âââ master
âââ origin/
    âââ master
    âââ new-branch

Think of your remote-tracking branches as your local cache for what the remote machines contain. You can update your remote-tracking branches using git fetch, which git pull uses behind the scenes.
Even though all the data for a remote-tracking branch is stored locally on your machine (like a cache), it's still never called a local branch. (At least, I wouldn't call it that!) It's just called a remote-tracking branch.
Branches on a remote machine:
You can view all the remote branches (that is, the branches on the remote machine), by running git remote show <remote>:
$ git remote show origin
* remote origin
  Fetch URL: git@github.com:Flimm/example.git
  Push  URL: git@github.com:Flimm/example.git
  HEAD branch: master
  Remote branches:
    io-socket-ip            new (next fetch will store in remotes/origin)
    master                  tracked
    new-branch              tracked
  Local ref configured for 'git pull':
    master     merges with remote master
    new-branch merges with remote new-branch
  Local ref configured for 'git push':
    master     pushes to master     (up to date)
    new-branch pushes to new-branch (fast-forwardable)

This git remote command queries the remote machine over the network about its branches. It does not update the remote-tracking branches on your local machine, use git fetch or git pull for that.
From the output, you can see all the branches that exist on the remote machine by looking under the heading ""Remote branches"" (ignore lines marked as ""stale"").
If you could log in to the remote machine and find the repository in the filesystem, you could have a look at all its branches under refs/heads/. 
Cheat sheet:

To delete a local branch, whether tracking or non-tracking, safely:
git branch -d <brachname>

To delete a local branch, whether tracking or non-tracking, forcefully:
git branch -D <branchname>

To delete a remote-tracking branch:
git branch -rd <remote>/<branchname>

To create a new local non-tracking branch:
git branch <branchname> [<start-point>]

To create a new local tracking branch: (Note that if <start-point> is specified and is a remote-tracking branch like origin/foobar, then the --track flag is automatically included)
git branch --track <branchname> [<start-point]

Example:
git branch --track hello-kitty origin/hello-kitty

To delete a branch on a remote machine:
git push --delete <remote> <branchname>

To delete all remote-tracking branches that are stale, that is, where the corresponding branches on the remote machine no longer exist:
git remote prune <remote>



You may have noticed that in some commands, you use <remote>/<branch>, and other commands, <remote> <branch>. Examples: git branch origin/hello-kitty and git push --delete origin hello-kitty.
It may seem arbritrary, but there's simple way to remember when to use a slash and when to use a space. When you're using a slash, you're referring to a remote-tracking branch on your own machine, whereas when you're using a space, you're actually dealing with a branch on a remote machine over the network.

Simply run xbuild just as you would execute msbuild on Microsoft .Net Framework. You don't need Monodevelop installed, xbuild comes with the standard Mono installation.
If your build uses custom tasks, they should still work if they don't depend on Windows executables (such as rmdir or xcopy).
When you are editing project files, use standard Windows path syntax - they will be converted by xbuild, if necessary. One important caveat to this rule is case sensitivity - don't mix different casings of the same file name. If you have a project that does this, you can enable compatibility mode by invoking MONO_IOMAP=case xbuild foo.sln (or try MONO_IOMAP=all).

Personally, I would leave it out.
EDIT
I stand corrected. After a little googling, the wikipedia page says:

@return    [type description]  This tag should not be used for constructors or methods defined with a void return type.

The phpdoc.org website says:

@return  datatype  description
  @return datatype1|datatype2 description
The @return tag is used to document the return value of functions or methods. @returns is an alias for @return to support tag formats of other automatic documentors
The datatype should be a valid PHP type (int, string, bool, etc), a class name for the type of object returned, or simply ""mixed"". If you want to explicitly show multiple possible return types, list them pipe-delimited without spaces (e.g. ""@return int|string""). If a class name is used as the datatype in the @return tag, phpDocumentor will automatically create a link to that class's documentation.

24007718,957768.0,2014-06-03 05:27:11+00:00,24007650,722,"Swift itself doesn't use selectors â several design patterns that in Objective-C make use of selectors work differently in Swift. (For example, use optional chaining on protocol types or is/as tests instead of respondsToSelector: tests, and use closures wherever you can instead of performSelector: for better type/memory safety.)
But there are still a number of important ObjC-based APIs that use selectors, including timers and the target/action pattern. Swift provides the Selector type for working with these. (Swift automatically uses this in place of ObjC's SEL type.)
In Swift 2.2 (Xcode 7.3) and later (including Swift 3 / Xcode 8):
You can construct a Selector from a Swift function type using the #selector expression.
let timer = NSTimer(timeInterval: 1, target: object,
                    selector: #selector(MyClass.test),
                    userInfo: nil, repeats: false)
button.addTarget(object, action: #selector(MyClass.buttonTapped),
                 forControlEvents: .TouchUpInside)
view.performSelector(#selector(UIView.insertSubview(_:aboveSubview:)),
                     withObject: button, withObject: otherButton)

The great thing about this approach? A function reference is checked by the Swift compiler, so you can use the #selector expression only with class/method pairs that actually exist and are eligible for use as selectors (see ""Selector availability"" below). You're also free to make your function reference only as specific as you need, as per the new Swift 2.2 rules for function naming.
(This is actually an improvement over ObjC's @selector() directive, because the compiler's -Wundeclared-selector check verifies only that the named selector exists. The Swift function reference you pass to #selector checks existence, membership in a class, and type signature.)
Sometimes you don't have a function reference to make a selector with (for example, with actions bound to the first responder, Cocoa KVC accessors, or methods dynamically registered in the ObjC runtime). In that case, you can construct a Selector from a string: e.g. Selector(""paste:"") â though you lose the compiler's validity checking.
There are a couple of extra caveats for the function references you pass to the #selector expression:

Multiple functions with the same base name can be differentiated by their parameter labels using the aforementioned syntax for function references (e.g. insertSubview(_:at:) vs insertSubview(_:aboveSubview:)). But if a function has no parameters, the only way to disambiguate it is to use an as cast with the function's type signature (e.g. foo as () -> () vs foo(_:)).
Swift doesn't know about the ObjC accessors for property getter/setter pairs. So, for example, given a var foo: Int, there isn't a func setFoo(_:) that you can construct a #selector from, even though there is a Selector(setFoo:).

General notes:
Selector availability: The method referenced by the selector must be exposed to the ObjC runtime. This is already the case if it's in a class that (ultimately) inherits from NSObject, but if it's in a pure Swift class you'll need to preface that method's declaration with @objc. Remember that private symbols aren't exposed to the runtime, too â your method needs to have at least internal visibility.
Selector names: Because selectors are an ObjC thing, they follow ObjC method naming rules, including colons (:) for each parameter. For example, the selector for a method named  test() is just ""test"", but the selector for test(this: String) is ""test:"", and for test(this: String, andThat: Int) it's ""test:andThat:"". Note that as the relationship between Swift and ObjC evolves, the names of some ObjC methods and their Swift syntax may diverge â but you can always use the @objc() attribute to control how a Swift method is exposed to ObjC.
You can read more about selectors under Interacting with Objective-C APIs in Using Swift with Cocoa and Objective-C.
Note: Before Swift 2.2, Selector conformed to StringLiteralConvertible, so you might find old code where bare strings are passed to APIs that take selectors. You'll want to run the migratory to get those converted to #selector syntax.

I'll try and recap
Definitions
The for comprehension is a syntax shortcut to combine flatMap and map in a way that's easy to read and reason about.
Let's simplify things a bit and assume that every class that provides both aforementioned methods can be called a monad and we'll use the symbol M[A] to mean a monad with an inner type A.
Examples
Some commonly seen monads

List[String] where


M[_]: List[_] 
A: String

Option[Int] where


M[_]: Option[_]
A: Int

Future[String => Boolean] where 


M[_]: Future[_]
A: String => Boolean


map and flatMap
Defined in a generic monad M[A]
 /* applies a transformation of the monad ""content"" mantaining the 
  * monad ""external shape""  
  * i.e. a List remains a List and an Option remains an Option 
  * but the inner type changes
  */
  def map(f: A => B): M[B] 

 /* applies a transformation of the monad ""content"" by composing
  * this monad with an operation resulting in another monad instance 
  * of the same type
  */
  def flatMap(f: A => M[B]): M[B]

e.g.
  val list = List(""neo"", ""smith"", ""trinity"")

  //converts each character of the string to its corresponding code
  val f: String => List[Int] = s => s.map(_.toInt).toList 

  list map f
  >> List(List(110, 101, 111), List(115, 109, 105, 116, 104), List(116, 114, 105, 110, 105, 116, 121))

  list flatMap f
  >> List(110, 101, 111, 115, 109, 105, 116, 104, 116, 114, 105, 110, 105, 116, 121)

for expression

Each line in the expression using the <- symbol is translated to a flatMap call, except for the last line which is translated to a concluding map call, where the ""bound symbol"" on the left-hand side is passed as the parameter to the argument function (what we previously called f: A => M[B]):
// The following ...
for {
  bound <- list
  out <- f(bound)
} yield out

// ... is translated by the Scala compiler as ...
list.flatMap { bound =>
  f(bound).map { out =>
    out
  }
}

// ... which can be simplified as ...
list.flatMap { bound =>
  f(bound)
}

// ... which is just another way of writing:
list flatMap f

A for-expression with only one <- is converted to a map call with the expression passed as argument:
// The following ...
for {
  bound <- list
} yield f(bound)

// ... is translated by the Scala compiler as ...
list.map { bound =>
  f(bound)
}

// ... which is just another way of writing:
list map f


Now to the point
As you can see, the map operation preserves the ""shape"" of the original monad, so the same happens for the yield expression: a List remains a List with the content transformed by the operation in the yield
On the other hand each binding line in the for is just a composition of successive monads, which must be ""flattened"" in order to maintain a single ""external shape""
Suppose for a moment that each internal binding was translated to a map call, but the right-hand was the same A => M[B] function, you would end up with a M[M[B]] for each line in the comprehension.
The intent of the whole for syntax is to easily ""flatten"" the concatenation of successive monadic operations (i.e. operations that ""lift"" a value in a ""monadic shape"": A => M[B]), with the addition of a final map operation that possibly performs a concluding transformation
I hope this explains the logic behind the choice of translation, which is applied in a mechanical way, that is: n flatMap nested calls concluded by a single map call.
A contrived illustrative example
Meant to show the expressiveness of the for syntax
case class Customer(value: Int)
case class Consultant(portfolio: List[Customer])
case class Branch(consultants: List[Consultant])
case class Company(branches: List[Branch])

def getCompanyValue(company: Company): Int = {

  val valuesList = for {
    branch     <- company.branches
    consultant <- branch.consultants
    customer   <- consultant.portfolio
  } yield (customer.value)

  valueList reduce (_ + _)
}

Can you guess the type of valuesList?
As already said, the shape of the monad is mantained through the comprehension, so we start with a List in company.branches, and must end with a List.
The inner type instead changes and is determined by the yield expression: which is customer.value: Int
valueList should be a List[Int]

What I am failing to understand is how a for-comprehension is a sequence of nested calls to map and flatMap. The following example is from Functional Programming in Scala
def bothMatch(pat:String,pat2:String,s:String):Option[Boolean] = for {
            f <- mkMatcher(pat)
            g <- mkMatcher(pat2)
 } yield f(s) && g(s)

translates to
def bothMatch(pat:String,pat2:String,s:String):Option[Boolean] = 
         mkMatcher(pat) flatMap (f => 
         mkMatcher(pat2) map (g => f(s) && g(s)))

The mkMatcher method is defined as follows:
  def mkMatcher(pat:String):Option[String => Boolean] = 
             pattern(pat) map (p => (s:String) => p.matcher(s).matches)

And the pattern method is as follows:
import java.util.regex._

def pattern(s:String):Option[Pattern] = 
  try {
        Some(Pattern.compile(s))
   }catch{
       case e: PatternSyntaxException => None
   }

It will be great if someone could shed some light on the rationale behind using map and flatMap here.

The answer is that in the case of (int)(6.2f * 10), you are taking the double value 61.99999809265137 and truncating it to an integer, which yields 61.
In the case of float f = 6.2f * 10, you are taking the double value 61.99999809265137 and rounding to the nearest float, which is 62. You then truncate that float to an integer, and the result is 62.
Exercise: Explain the results of the following sequence of operations.
double d = 6.2f * 10;
int tmp2 = (int)d;
// evaluate tmp2

Update: As noted in the comments, the expression 6.2f * 10 is formally a float since the second parameter has an implicit conversion to float which is better than the implicit conversion to double.
The actual issue is that the compiler is permitted (but not required) to use an intermediate which is higher precision than the formal type. That's why you see different behavior on different systems: In the expression (int)(6.2f * 10), the compiler has the option of keeping the value 6.2f * 10 in a high precision intermediate form before converting to int. If it does, then the result is 61. If it does not, then the result is 62.
In the second example, the explicit assignment to float forces the rounding to take place before the conversion to integer.

speed1 and speed2 should have the same value, but in fact, I have :
speed1 = 61
speed2 = 62

I looked at the generated bytecode, but except a store and a load, the opcodes are the same.
I also tried the same code in java, and I correctly obtain 62 and 62.
Can someone explain this ?
Edit : 
In the real code, it's not directly 6.2f * 10 but a function call * a constant. I have the following bytecode :
for speed 1 :

10029326,1312722.0,2012-04-05 13:15:07+00:00,10028770,373,"WebSockets - is definitely the future.
Long polling is dirty workaround of preventing creating connections for each request like AJAX does -- but long polling was created when WebSockets didn't exist. Now due to WebSockets, 
Long Polling is going away. And WebRTC allows peer-to-peer communication.
I recommend learning WebSockets.
Comparison:
of different communication techniques in web

AJAX - request → response. Creates connection to server, sends request headers with optional data, gets response from server, closes connection. Supported in all major browsers.
Long poll - request → wait → response. Creates connection to server like AJAX does, but keep-alive connection open for some time (not long though), during connection open client can receive data from server. Client have to reconnect periodically after connection is closed due to timeouts or data eof. On server side it is still treated like HTTP request same as AJAX, except the answer on request will happen now or some time in the future defined by application logic. Supported in all major browsers.
WebSockets - client ↔ server. Create TCP connection to server, and keep it as long as needed. Server or client can easily close it. Client goes through HTTP compatible handshake process, if it succeeds, then server and client can exchange data both directions at any time. It is very efficient if application requires frequent data exchange in both ways. WebSockets do have data framing that includes masking for each message sent from client to server so data is simply encrypted. support chart (very good)
WebRTC - peer ↔ peer. Transport to establish communication between clients and is transport-agnostic so uses UDP, TCP or even more abstract layers. By design it allows to transport data in reliable as well as unreliable ways. This is generally used for high volume data transfer such as video/audio streaming where reliability - is secondary and few frames or reduction in quality progression can be sacrificed in favour of response time and at least delivering something. Both sides (peers) can push data to each other independently. While it can be used totally independent from any centralised servers it still require some way of exchanging endPoints data, where in most cases developers still use centralised servers to ""link"" peers. This is required only to exchange essential data for connection establishing - after connection is established server on aside is not required. support chart (medium)
Server-Sent Events - client ← server. Client establishes persistent and long-term connection to server. Only server can send data to client. If client wants to send data to server it would require to use other technology/protocol to do so. This protocol is HTTP compatible and simple to implement in most server-side platforms. This is preferable protocol to be used instead of Long Polling. support chart (good, except IE)

Advantages:
Main advantage of WebSockets for server, is that it is not HTTP request (after handshake), but proper message based communication protocol. That allows you to achieve huge performance and architecture advantages. For example in node.js you can share the same memory for different socket connections, so that way they can access shared variables. So you don't need to use database as exchange point in the middle (like with AJAX or Long Polling and for example PHP).
You can store data in RAM, or even republish between sockets straight away.
Security considerations
People often are concerned regarding security of WebSockets. Reality is that it makes little difference or even puts WebSockets as better option. First of all with AJAX there is a higher chance of MITM as each request is new TCP connection and traversing through internet infrastructure. With WebSockets, once it's connected it is far more challenging to intercept in between, with additionally enforced frame masking when data is streamed from client to server as well as additional compression, that requires more effort to probe data. All modern protocols support both: HTTP and HTTPS (encrypted).
P.S.
Remember that WebSockets generally have a very different approach of logic for networking, more like real-time games had all this time, and not like http.

Currently, I am implementing this using simple AJAX, but this has the disadvantage of regularly hitting the server when a short timer elapses.
In researching long/short polling, I ran across HTML5 WebSockets. This seems easy to implement, but I'm not sure if there are some hidden disadvantages. For example, I think WebSockets is only supported by certain browsers. Are there other disadvantages to WebSockets that I should be aware of?
Since it seems like both technologies do the same thing, in what sorts of scenarios would one prefer to use one over the other? More specifically, has HTML5 WebSockets made AJAX long/short polling obsolete, or are there compelling reasons to prefer AJAX over WebSockets?

14869358,2071037.0,2013-02-14 06:55:34+00:00,2284860,62,"OK kiddies, time for the pros....
This is one of my biggest complaints with inexperienced software engineers. They come in calculating transcendental functions from scratch (using Taylor's series) as if nobody had ever done these calculations before in their lives. Not true. This is a well defined problem and has been approached thousands of times by very clever software and hardware engineers and has a well defined solution.
Basically, most of the transcendental functions use Chebyshev Polynomials to calculate them. As to which polynomials are used depends on the circumstances. First, the bible on this matter is a book called ""Computer Approximations"" by Hart and Cheney. In that book, you can decide if you have a hardware adder, multiplier, divider, etc, and decide which operations are fastest. e.g. If you had a really fast divider, the fastest way to calculate sine might be P1(x)/P2(x) where P1, P2 are Chebyshev polynomials. Without the fast divider, it might be just P(x), where P has much more terms than P1 or P2....so it'd be slower. So, first step is to determine your hardware and what it can do. Then you choose the appropriate combination of Chebyshev polynomials (is usually of the form cos(ax) = aP(x) for cosine for example, again where P is a Chebyshev polynomial). Then you decide what decimal precision you want. e.g. if you want 7 digits precision, you look that up in the appropriate table in the book I mentioned, and it will give you (for precision = 7.33) a number N = 4 and a polynomial number 3502. N is the order of the polynomial (so it's p4.x^4 + p3.x^3 + p2.x^2 + p1.x + p0), because N=4. Then you look up the actual value of the p4,p3,p2,p1,p0 values in the back of the book under 3502 (they'll be in floating point). Then you implement your algorithm in software in the form:
(((p4.x + p3).x + p2).x + p1).x + p0
....and this is how you'd calculate cosine to 7 decimal places on that hardware.
Note that most hardware implementations of transcendental operations in an FPU usually involve some microcode and operations like this (depends on the hardware).
Chebyshev polynomials are used for most transcendentals but not all. e.g. Square root is faster to use a double iteration of Newton raphson method using a lookup table first.
Again, that book ""Computer Approximations"" will tell you that.
If you plan on implmementing these functions, I'd recommend to anyone that they get a copy of that book. It really is the bible for these kinds of algorithms.
Note that there are bunches of alternative means for calculating these values like cordics, etc, but these tend to be best for specific algorithms where you only need low precision. To guarantee the precision every time, the chebyshev polynomials are the way to go. Like I said, well defined problem. Has been solved for 50 years now.....and thats how it's done.
Now, that being said, there are techniques whereby the Chebyshev polynomials can be used to get a single precision result with a low degree polynomial (like the example for cosine above). Then, there are other techniques to interpolate between values to increase the accuracy without having to go to a much larger polynomial, such as ""Gal's Accurate Tables Method"". This latter technique is what the post referring to the ACM literature is referring to. But ultimately, the Chebyshev Polynomials are what are used to get 90% of the way there.
Enjoy.

Edit: I'm aware of several ways that functions can be calculated, and have written my own routines to compute functions using taylor series for fun.  I'm curious about how real, production languages do it, since all of my implementations are always several orders of magnitude slower, even though I think my algorithms are pretty clever (obviously they're not).

The Configurator can be called by multiple threads at the same time, it is likely that you will not have access to the correct HttpSession object between the calls from modifyHandshake() and getEndpointInstance().
Or said another way...

Request A
Modify Handshake A
Request B
Modify Handshake B
Get Endpoint Instance A  <-- this would have Request B's HttpSession
Get Endpoint Instance B

Here's a modification to Martin's code that uses ServerEndpointConfig.getUserProperties() map to make the HttpSession available to your socket instance during the @OnOpen method call
GetHttpSessionConfigurator.java

import javax.servlet.http.HttpSession;
import javax.websocket.HandshakeResponse;
import javax.websocket.server.HandshakeRequest;
import javax.websocket.server.ServerEndpointConfig;

public class GetHttpSessionConfigurator extends ServerEndpointConfig.Configurator
{
    @Override
    public void modifyHandshake(ServerEndpointConfig config, 
                                HandshakeRequest request, 
                                HandshakeResponse response)
    {
        HttpSession httpSession = (HttpSession)request.getHttpSession();
        config.getUserProperties().put(HttpSession.class.getName(),httpSession);
    }
}

GetHttpSessionSocket.java
package examples;

import java.io.IOException;

import javax.servlet.http.HttpSession;
import javax.websocket.EndpointConfig;
import javax.websocket.OnMessage;
import javax.websocket.OnOpen;
import javax.websocket.Session;
import javax.websocket.server.ServerEndpoint;

@ServerEndpoint(value = ""/example"", 
                configurator = GetHttpSessionConfigurator.class)
public class GetHttpSessionSocket
{
    private Session wsSession;
    private HttpSession httpSession;

    @OnOpen
    public void open(Session session, EndpointConfig config) {
        this.wsSession = session;
        this.httpSession = (HttpSession) config.getUserProperties()
                                           .get(HttpSession.class.getName());
    }

    @OnMessage
    public void echo(String msg) throws IOException {
        wsSession.getBasicRemote().sendText(msg);
    }
}

Bonus feature: no instanceof or casting required.
Some EndpointConfig Knowledge
EndpointConfig objects do exist per ""Endpoint Instance"".
However, an ""Endpoint Instance"" has 2 meanings with the spec.

Default behavior of the JSR, where each incoming upgrade request results in a new object instance of the endpoint class
A javax.websocket.Session that ties together the object endpoint instance, with its configuration, to a specific logical connection.

It is possible to have a singleton Endpoint instance being used for multiple javax.websocket.Session instances (that is one of the features that ServerEndpointConfig.Configurator supports)
The ServerContainer implementation will track a set of ServerEndpointConfig's that represent all of the deployed endpoints that the server can respond to a websocket upgrade request.
These ServerEndpointConfig object instances can come from a few different sources.

Manually provided by the javax.websocket.server.ServerContainer.addEndpoint(ServerEndpointConfig)

Usually done within a javax.servlet.ServletContextInitializer.contextInitialized(ServletContextEvent sce) call

From the javax.websocket.server.ServerApplicationConfig.getEndpointConfigs(Set) call.
Automatically created from scanning of the web application for @ServerEndpoint annotated classes.

These ServerEndpointConfig object instances exist as defaults for when a javax.websocket.Session does eventually get created.
ServerEndpointConfig.Configurator Instance
Before any upgrade requests are received or processed, all of the ServerEndpointConfig.Configurator objects now exist and are ready to perform their main and sole purpose, to allow for customization of the upgrade process of a websocket connection to an eventual javax.websocket.Session
Access to Session specific EndpointConfig
Note, you cannot access the ServerEndpointConfig object instances from within a endpoint instance.  You can only access EndpointConfig instances.
This means if you provided ServerContainer.addEndpoint(new MyCustomServerEndpointConfig()) during deploy and later tried to access it via the annotations, it will not work.
All of the following would be invalid.
@OnOpen
public void onOpen(Session session, EndpointConfig config)
{
    MyCustomServerEndpointConfig myconfig = (MyCustomServerEndpointConfig) config;
    /* this would fail as the config is cannot be cast around like that */
}

// --- or ---

@OnOpen
public void onOpen(Session session, ServerEndpointConfig config)
{
    /* For @OnOpen, the websocket implementation would assume
       that the ServerEndpointConfig to be a declared PathParam
     */
}

// --- or ---

@OnOpen
public void onOpen(Session session, MyCustomServerEndpointConfig config)
{
    /* Again, for @OnOpen, the websocket implementation would assume
       that the MyCustomServerEndpointConfig to be a declared PathParam
     */
}

You can access the EndpointConfig during the life of the Endpoint object instance, but under a limited time.  The javax.websocket.Endpoint.onOpen(Session,Endpoint), annotated @OnOpen methods, or via the use of CDI.  The EndpointConfig is not available in any other way or at any other time.
However, you can always access the UserProperties via the Session.getUserProperties() call, which is available always.  This User Properties map is always available, be it via the annotated techniques (such as a Session parameter during @OnOpen, @OnClose, @OnError, or @OnMessage calls), via CDI injection of the Session, or even with the use of non-annotated websockets that extend from javax.websocket.Endpoint.
How Upgrade Works
As stated before, every one of the defined endpoints will have a ServerEndpointConfig associated with it.
Those ServerEndpointConfigs are a single instance that represents the default state of the EndpointConfig that are eventually made available to the Endpoint Instances that are possibly and eventually created.
When a incoming upgrade request arrives, it has go through the following on the JSR.

does the path match any of the ServerEndpointConfig.getPath() entries

If no match, return 404 to upgrade

pass upgrade request into ServerEndpointConfig.Configurator.checkOrigin()

If not valid, return error to upgrade response
create HandshakeResponse

pass upgrade request into ServerEndpointConfig.Configurator.getNegotiatedSubprotocol()

store answer in HandshakeResponse

pass upgrade request into ServerEndpointConfig.Configurator.getNegotiatedExtensions()

store answer in HandshakeResponse

Create new endpoint specific ServerEndpointConfig object. copy encoders, decoders, and User Properties.  This new ServerEndpointConfig wraps default for path, extensions, endpoint class, subprotocols, configurator.
pass upgrade request, response, and new ServerEndpointConfig into ServerEndpointConfig.Configurator.modifyHandshake()
call ServerEndpointConfig.getEndpointClass()
use class on ServerEndpointConfig.Configurator.getEndpointInstance(Class)
create Session, associate endpoint instance and EndpointConfig object.
Inform endpoint instance of connect
annotated methods that want EndpointConfig gets the one associated with this Session.
calls to Session.getUserProperties() returns EndpointConfig.getUserProperties()

To note, the ServerEndpointConfig.Configurator is a singleton, per mapped ServerContainer endpoint.
This is intentional, and desired, to allow implementors several features.

to return the same Endpoint instance for multiple peers if they so desire.  The so called stateless approach to websocket writing.
to have a single point of management of expensive resources for all Endpoint instances

If the implementations created a new Configurator for every handshake, this technique would not be possible.

The reason for this is that range copies the values from the slice you're iterating over.
The specification about range says:

Range expression                          1st value             2nd value (if 2nd variable is present)
array or slice  a   [n]E, *[n]E, or []E   index    i  int       a[i]       E


So, range uses a[i] as its second value for arrays/slices, which effectively means that the
value is copied, making the original value untouchable.
This behavior is demonstrated by the following code:
x := make([]int, 3)

x[0], x[1], x[2] = 1, 2, 3

for i, val := range x {
    println(&x[i], ""vs."", &val)
}

The code prints you completely different memory locations for the value from range and the actual 
value  in the slice:
0xf84000f010 vs. 0x7f095ed0bf68
0xf84000f014 vs. 0x7f095ed0bf68
0xf84000f018 vs. 0x7f095ed0bf68

So the only thing you can do is to either use pointers or the index, as already proposed by jnml and peterSO.

4457821,1588.0,2010-12-16 05:49:19+00:00,4457790,78,"Absolute positioning means that the element is taken completely out of the normal flow of the page layout. As far as the rest of the elements on the page are concerned, the absolutely positioned element simply doesn't exist. The element itself is then drawn separately, sort of ""on top"" of everything else, at the position you specify using the left, right, top and bottom attributes. 
Using the position you specify with these attributes, the element is then placed at that position within it's last ancestor element which has a position attribute of anything other than static (static is the positioning elements use if they have no position attribute specified), or the document body (browser viewport) if no such ancestor exists.
For example, if I had this code:
<body>
  <div style=""position:absolute; left: 20px; top: 20px;""></div>
</body>

...then the <div> would be positioned 20 px from the top of the browser viewport, and 20px from the left edge of same.
However, if I did something like this:
 <div id=""outer"" style=""position:relative"">
   <div id=""inner"" style=""position:absolute; left: 20px; top: 20px;""></div>
 </div>

...then the inner div would be positioned 20px from the top of the outer div, and 20px from the left edge of same, because the outer div isn't positioned with position:static because we've explicitly set it to use position:relative.
Relative positioning, on the other hand, is just like stating no positioning at all, but the left, right, top and bottom attributes ""nudge"" the element out of their normal layout. The rest of the elements on the page still get laid out as if the element was in its normal spot though.
For example, if I had this code:
<span>Span1</span>
<span>Span2</span>
<span>Span3</span>

...then all three <span> elements would sit next to each other without overlapping.
If I set the second <span> to use relative positioning, like this:
<span>Span1</span>
<span style=""position: relative; left: -5px;"">Span2</span>
<span>Span3</span>

...then Span2 would overlap the right side of Span1 by 5px. Span1 and Span3 would sit in exactly the same place as they did in the first example, leaving a 5px gap between the right side of Span2 and the left side of Span3.
Hope that clarifies things a bit.

CSS provides only two values for its ""list-style-position"" - inside and outside. With ""inside"" second lines are flush with the list points not with the superior line:
3. longer Text, longer Text, longer Text, longer Text, longer Text, longer Text
second line of longer Text
4. Text

Width ""outside"" my list is not flush with superior text blocks anymore.
Experiments width text-indent, padding-left and margin-left work for unordered lists but they fail for ordered lists because it depends on the list-decimal's number of characters:
 Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit. 
 Aenean commodo ligula eget dolor.

Thanks god, the previous guy wrote some unit tests (MSTests). I quite comfortable with JUnit tests, but didn't do yet much with MSTests.
The test methods have a DeploymentItem attribute, specifying a text file which is parsed by the business logic method that is being tested and a 2nd DeploymentItem where just a path has been specified containing a bunch of TIF files that have to be deployed too.

[DeploymentItem(@""files\valid\valid_entries.txt"")]
[DeploymentItem(@""files\tif\"")]

The tests worked before, but now I had to change the names of the TIF files contained in the \files\tif directory. According to a rule, the TIF filenames have to match a certain pattern which is also checked by the ExistsTifTest() method.
Now I had to change the filenames in order to adapt them to the new requirements and suddently the TIF files are no more being deployed as before.
Can someone give me a hint why this happens or what may be the cause? The same thing happens also if I add a new text-file say ""my2ndTest.txt"" beside the ""valid_entries.txt"" in the \files\valid\ directory with the according DeploymentItem attribute on the test method. The file doesn't get deployed?
I got the images now deployed by defining the deployment path directly in the testrunconfig, but I'd like to understand why these things happen or why for instance my new file ""my2ndTest.txt"" doesn't get deployed while the others do.
Thanks a lot.

14085710,734069.0,2012-12-29 20:37:14+00:00,14085620,97,"Half of the purpose of the = delete syntax is to be able to prevent people from calling certain functions with certain parameters. This is mainly to prevent implicit conversions in certain specific scenarios. In order to forbid a particular overload, it has to participate in overload resolution.
The answer you cite gives you a perfect example:
struct onlydouble {
  onlydouble(std::intmax_t) = delete;
  onlydouble(double);
};

If delete removed the function entirely, that would make the = delete syntax equivalent to this:
struct onlydouble2 {
  onlydouble2(double);
};

You could do this:
onlydouble2 val(20);

This is legal C++. The compiler will look at all constructors; none of them take an integer type directly. But one of them can take it after an implicit conversion. So it'll call that.
onlydouble val(20);

This is not legal C++. The compiler will look at all constructors, including the deleted ones. It will see an exact match, via std::intmax_t (which will exactly match any integer literal). So the compiler will select it and then immediately issue an error, because it selected a deleted function.
= delete means ""I forbid this,"" not merely, ""This does not exist."" It's a much stronger statement.

I was asking why the C++ standard says = delete means ""I forbid this"" instead of ""this does not exist""

It's because we don't need special grammar to say ""this does not exist."" We get this implicitly by simply not declaring the particular ""this"" in question. ""I forbid this"" represents a construct that cannot be achieved without special grammar. So we get special grammar to say ""I forbid this"" and not the other thing.
The only functionality you would gain by having an explicit ""this does not exist"" grammar would be to prevent someone from later declaring it to exist. And that's just not useful enough to need its own grammar.

there is otherwise no way to declare that the copy constructor does not exist, and its existence can cause nonsensical ambiguities.

The copy constructor is a special member function. Every class always has a copy constructor. Just as they always have a copy assignment operator, move constructor, etc.
These functions exist; the question is only whether it is legal to call them. If you tried to say that = delete meant that they didn't exist, then the specification would have to explain what it means for a function to not exist. This is not a concept that the specification handles.
If you attempt to call a function that hasn't been declared/defined yet, then the compiler will error. But it will error because of an undefined identifier, not because of a ""function doesn't exist"" error (even if your compiler reports it that way). Various constructors are all called by overload resolution, so their ""existence"" is handled in that regard.
In every case, there is either a function declared via identifier, or a constructor/destructor (also declared via identifier, just a type-identifier). Operator overloading hides the identifier behind syntactic sugar, but it's still there.
The C++ specification cannot handle the concept of a ""function that does not exist."" It can handle an overload mismatch. It can handle an overload ambiguity. But it doesn't know about what isn't there. So = delete is defined in terms of the far more useful ""attempts to call this fail"" rather than the less useful ""pretend I never wrote this line.""
And again, re-read the first part. You cannot do that with ""function doesn't exist."" That's another reason why it's defined that way: because one of the main use cases of the = delete syntax is to be able to force the user to use certain parameter types, to explicitly cast, and so forth. Basically, to foil implicit type conversions.
Your suggestion would not do that.

            var attr = property.GetCustomAttribute<DateTimeKindAttribute>();
            if (attr == null)
                continue;

            var dt = property.PropertyType == typeof(DateTime?)
                ? (DateTime?) property.GetValue(entity)
                : (DateTime) property.GetValue(entity);

            if (dt == null)
                continue;

            property.SetValue(entity, DateTime.SpecifyKind(dt.Value, attr.Kind));
        }
    }
}

Now hook that attribute up to your EF context:
public class MyContext : DbContext
{
    public DbSet<Foo> Foos { get; set; }

    public MyContext()
    {
        ((IObjectContextAdapter)this).ObjectContext.ObjectMaterialized +=
            (sender, e) => DateTimeKindAttribute.Apply(e.Entity);
    }
}

Now on any DateTime or DateTime? properties, you can apply this attribute:
public class Foo
{
    public int Id { get; set; }

    [DateTimeKind(DateTimeKind.Utc)]
    public DateTime Bar { get; set; }
}

With this in place, whenever Entity Framework loads an entity from the database, it will set the DateTimeKind that you specify, such as UTC.
Note that this doesn't do anything when saving.  You'll still have to have the value properly converted to UTC before you try to save it.  But it does allow you to set the kind when retrieving, which allows it to be serialized as UTC, or converted to other time zones with TimeZoneInfo.

delay = (ms, func) -> setTimeout func, ms

delay 1000, -> something param

Granted, this adds the overhead of an extra function call to every setTimeout you make; but in today's JS interpreters, the performance drawback is insignificant unless you're doing it thousands of times per second. (And what are you doing setting thousands of timeouts per second, anyway?)
Of course, a more straightforward approach is to simply name your callback, which tends to produce more readable code anyway (jashkenas is a big fan of this idiom):

As an improvement the javascript code could be shortened by writing a jquery plugin to avoid duplicating some parts.

UPDATE: 
And talking about a plugin you could have something among the lines:
(function ($) {
    $.fn.cascade = function (options) {
        var defaults = { };
        var opts = $.extend(defaults, options);

        return this.each(function () {
            $(this).change(function () {
                var selectedValue = $(this).val();
                var params = { };
                params[opts.paramName] = selectedValue;
                $.getJSON(opts.url, params, function (items) {
                    opts.childSelect.empty();
                    $.each(items, function (index, item) {
                        opts.childSelect.append(
                            $('<option/>')
                                .attr('value', item.Id)
                                .text(item.Name)
                        );
                    });
                });
            });
        });
    };
})(jQuery);

And then simply wire it up:
$(function () {
    $('#SelectedProvinceId').cascade({
        url: '@Url.Action(""Cities"")',
        paramName: 'provinceId',
        childSelect: $('#SelectedCityId')
    });

    $('#SelectedCityId').cascade({
        url: '@Url.Action(""Suburbs"")',
        paramName: 'cityId',
        childSelect: $('#SelectedSuburbId')
    });

prevent core dumps (many daemons run as root, and core dumps can contain sensitive information)

set UID, GID, working directory, umask, and other process parameters appropriately for the use case
relinquish elevated suid, sgid privileges
close all open file descriptors, with exclusions depending on the use case
behave correctly if started inside an already-detached context, such as init, inetd, etc.
set up signal handlers for sensible daemon behaviour, but also with specific handlers determined by the use case
redirect the standard streams stdin, stdout, stderr since a daemon process no longer has a controlling terminal
handle a PID file as a cooperative advisory lock, which is a whole can of worms in itself with many contradictory but valid ways to behave
allow proper cleanup when the process is terminated
actually become a daemon process without leading to zombies

Some of these are standard, as described in canonical Unix literature (Advanced Programming in the UNIX Environment, by the late W. Richard Stevens, Addison-Wesley, 1992). Others, such as stream redirection and PID file handling, are conventional behaviour most daemon users would expect but that are less standardised.
All of these are covered by the PEP 3143 âStandard daemon process libraryâ specification. The python-daemon reference implementation works on Python 2.7 or later, and Python 3.2 or later.

So you created this promise: Calling copy() will return its own type, fully initialized.
But then you implemented copy() this way:
func copy() -> Self {
    return C()
}

Now I'm a subclass that doesn't override copy(). And I return a C, not a fully-initialized Self (which I promised). So that's no good. How about:
func copy() -> Self {
    return Self()
}

Well, that won't compile, but even if it did, it'd be no good. The subclass may have no trivial constructor, so D() might not even be legal. (Though see below.)
OK, well how about:
func copy() -> C {
    return C()
}

Yes, but that doesn't return Self. It returns C. You're still not keeping your promise.
""But ObjC can do it!"" Well, sort of. Mostly because it doesn't care if you keep your promise the way Swift does. If you fail to implement copyWithZone: in the subclass, you may fail to fully initialize your object. The compiler won't even warn you that you've done that.
""But most everything in ObjC can be translated to Swift, and ObjC has NSCopying."" Yes it does, and here's how it's defined:
func copy() -> AnyObject!

So you can do the same (there's no reason for the ! here):
protocol Copyable {
  func copy() -> AnyObject
}

That says ""I'm not promising anything about what you get back."" You could also say:
protocol Copyable {
  func copy() -> Copyable
}

That's a promise you can make.
But we can think about C++ for a little while and remember that there's a promise we can make. We can promise that we and all our subclasses will implement specific kinds of initializers, and Swift will enforce that (and so can prove we're telling the truth):
protocol Copyable {
  init(copy: Self)
}

class C : Copyable {
  required init(copy: C) {
    // Perform your copying here.
  }
}

And that is how you should perform copies.
We can take this one step further, but it uses dynamicType, and I haven't tested it extensively to make sure that is always what we want, but it should be correct:
protocol Copyable {
  func copy() -> Self
  init(copy: Self)
}

class C : Copyable {
  func copy() -> Self {
    return self.dynamicType(copy: self)
  }

  required init(copy: C) {
    // Perform your copying here.
  }
}

Here we promise that there is an initializer that performs copies for us, and then we can at runtime determine which one to call, giving us the method syntax you were looking for.

There are a lot of good answers here, and one amazing one about the zen of vi.  One thing I don't see mentioned is that vim is extremely extensible via plugins.  There are scripts and plugins to make it do all kinds of crazy things the original author never considered.  Here are a few examples of incredibly handy vim plugins: 
rails.vim
Rails.vim is a plugin written by tpope. It's an incredible tool for people doing rails development.  It does magical context-sensitive things that allow you to easily jump from a method in a controller to the associated view, over to a model, and down to unit tests for that model.  It has saved dozens if not hundreds of hours as a rails developer. 
gist.vim
This plugin allows you to select a region of text in visual mode and type a quick command to post it to gist.github.com.  This allows for easy pastebin access, which is incredibly handy if you're collaborating with someone over IRC or IM.  
space.vim
This plugin provides special functionality to the spacebar.  It turns the spacebar into something analogous to the period, but instead of repeating actions it repeats motions.  This can be very handy for moving quickly through a file in a way you define on the fly. 
surround.vim
This plugin gives you the ability to work with text that is delimited in some fashion.  It gives you objects which denote things inside of parens, things inside of quotes, etc.  It can come in handy for manipulating delimited text. 
supertab.vim
This script brings fancy tab completion functionality to vim.  The autocomplete stuff is already there in the core of vim, but this brings it to a quick tab rather than multiple different multikey shortcuts.  Very handy, and incredibly fun to use.  While it's not VS's intellisense, it's a great step and brings a great deal of the functionality you'd like to expect from a tab completion tool.
syntastic.vim
This tool brings external syntax checking commands into vim.  I haven't used it personally, but I've heard great things about it and the concept is hard to beat.  Checking syntax without having to do it manually is a great time saver and can help you catch syntactic bugs as you introduce them rather than when you finally stop to test. 
fugitive.vim
Direct access to git from inside of vim.  Again, I haven't used this plugin, but I can see the utility.  Unfortunately I'm in a culture where svn is considered ""new"", so I won't likely see git at work for quite some time. 
nerdtree.vim
A tree browser for vim.  I started using this recently, and it's really handy.  It lets you put a treeview in a vertical split and open files easily.  This is great for a project with a lot of source files you frequently jump between.  
FuzzyFinderTextmate.vim
This is an unmaintained plugin, but still incredibly useful.  It provides the ability to open files using a ""fuzzy"" descriptive syntax.  It means that in a sparse tree of files you need only type enough characters to disambiguate the files you're interested in from the rest of the cruft.  
Conclusion
There are a lot of incredible tools available for vim.  I'm sure I've only scratched the surface here, and it's well worth searching for tools applicable to your domain.  The combination of traditional vi's powerful toolset, vim's improvements on it, and plugins which extend vim even further, it's one of the most powerful ways to edit text ever conceived.  Vim is easily as powerful as emacs, eclipse, visual studio, and textmate.

It really seems you should be (as a developer) faster with Vim than with any other editor.
I'm using Vim to do some basic stuff and I'm at best 10 times less productive with Vim.
The only two things you should care about when you talk about speed (you may not care enough about them, but you should) are:

Using alternatively left and right
hands is the fastest way to use the
keyboard. 
Never touching the mouse is the
second way to be as fast as possible.
It takes ages for you to move your hand,
grab the mouse, move it, and bring it
back to the keyboard (and you often have
to look at the keyboard to be sure you
returned your hand properly to the right place)

Here are two examples demonstrating why I'm far less productive with Vim.
Copy/Cut & paste. I do it all the time. With all the contemporary editors you press Shift  with the left hand, and you move the cursor with your right hand to select text. Then Ctrl+C copies, you move the cursor and Ctrl+V pastes.
With Vim it's horrible:

yy to copy one line (you almost never want the whole line!)
[number xx]yy to copy xx lines into the buffer. But you never know exactly if you've selected what you wanted. I often have to do [number xx]dd then u to undo!

Another example? Search & replace.

In PSPad: Ctrl+f then type what you want you search for, then press Enter.
In Vim: /, then type what you want to search for, then if there are some special characters put \ before each special character, then press Enter.

And everything with Vim is like that: it seems I don't know how to handle it the right way.
NB : I've already read the Vim cheat sheet :)
My question is:
What is the way you use Vim that makes you more productive than with a contemporary editor?

In those languages it is perfectly possible to have a function returning the current time. From the languages you tagged this question with this applies to scala and f# (as well as most other variants of ML).
In languages like Haskell and Clean, which are pure, the situation is different. In Haskell the current time would not be available through a function, but a so-called IO action, which is Haskell's way of encapsulating side effects.
In Clean it would be a function, but the function would take a world value as its argument and return a fresh world value (in addition to the current time) as its result. The type system would make sure that each world value can be used only once (and each function which consumes a world value would produces a new one). This way the time function would have to be called with a different argument each time and thus would be allowed to return a different time each time.

I read about it from here and there, and so came to know that in functional programming, a function returns the same output, for same input, no matter how many times the function is called.  It's exactly like mathematical function which evaluates to same output for same value of input parameter which involves in the function expression. 
For example, consider this:
f(x,y) = x*x + y; //it is a mathematical function

No matter how many times you use f(10,4), its value will always be 104. As such, wherever you've written f(10,4), you can replace it with 104, without altering the value of the whole expression. This property is referred to as referential transparency of an expression.
As Wikipedia says (link),

Conversely, in functional code, the output value of a function depends only on the arguments that are input to the function, so calling a function f twice with the same value for an argument x will produce the same result f(x) both times. 

So my question is: can a time function (which returns the current time) exist in functional programming? 

If yes, then how can it exist? Does it not violate the principle of functional programming? It particularly violates referential transparency which is one of the property of functional programming (if I correctly understand it).
Or if no, then how can one know the current time in functional programming?

However, when you are loading things from a server, you also have to think about latency. If you pack all of your network communication into viewDidLoad or viewWillAppear, they will be executed before the user gets to see the view - possibly resulting a short freeze of your app. It may be good idea to first show the user an unpopulated view with an activity indicator of some sort. When you are done with your networking, which may take a second or two (or may even fail - who knows?), you can populate the view with your data.

The only way to set any color (with any alpha) is to use backgroundView:
Swift
self.backgroundView = UIView(frame: self.bounds)
self.backgroundView.backgroundColor = UIColor(white: 0.5, alpha: 0.5)

Obj-C
self.backgroundView = ({
    UIView * view = [[UIView alloc] initWithFrame:self.bounds];
    view.backgroundColor = [UIColor colorWithWhite: 0.5 alpha:0.5];
    view;
    });


Responses to Comments 

None of these other options reliably work (despite the comments below)
// self.contentView.backgroundColor = [UIColor clearColor];
// self.backgroundColor = [UIColor clearColor];
// self.tintColor = [UIColor clearColor];

the backgroundView is resized automatically. (No need to add constraints)
Control alpha with UIColor(white: 0.5, alpha: 0.5) or backgroundView.alpha = 0.5.
(of course, any color will do)
When using XIB, make root view a UITableViewHeaderFooterView and associate the backgroundView programmatically:
Register with:
tableView.registerNib(UINib(nibName: ""Header"", bundle: nil),
                      forHeaderFooterViewReuseIdentifier: ""header"")

Load with:
override func tableView(tableView: UITableView, viewForHeaderInSection section: Int)
    -> UIView? {
    if let head = tableView.dequeueReusableHeaderFooterViewWithIdentifier(""header"") {
        let backgroundView = UIView(frame: header.bounds)

Sadly, this stirs in all the Dilbert and Parkinson's Law complexities.
The best you can conclude is that decisions will be justified on the basis of risk, cost, and benefit, but will tend to be made on the basis of what credit and blame is in store for the agent and understood by the agent, which is a narrow risk consideration of questionable value to the principal but at least an identifiable one.
So, we should now apply this to the language question.  Your manager is likely to avoid threats, risks, scandals, and controversies. His application of the principals's concerns will be mainly through the constraints of budgets and expectations. Here are some examples that should be mostly self-explanatory.
If you want to use Java or PHP: 

Everyone is doing it this way
This is the industry-standard approach for this type of problem
This is the low-risk approach
Similar systems have been done many times in Java/PHP

(That's the ""no one ever got fired for buying IBM"" argument.)
If you want to use Ruby:

Ruby is in the Tiobe top-ten (not quite an industry standard, so this is the best you can do) 
PHP and Java are higher-cost technologies (he probably has a budget as an attempt to mitigate the principal-agent problem)
PHP and Java are going to be out of fashion ""soon"" (maybe not, but phrased as a ""risk of appearing to stupidly use old tech', and implying the lack of later credit and recognition)
Ruby is an advanced language with powerful abstractions for cost-effective development (a weak argument for the agent, but offers the possibility of credit. The least effective of all the arguments.)

If you want to use Clojure:

You better prototype the system on weekends and evenings and present it as a solved problem. 
Emphasize parallel Java / Clojure development (""if necessary the entire system can be written in Clojure Java"")
Make all the Java arguments and then say something about ""the best of both worlds""

I resolved it with a much easier way.
Method One
You can either remove the dataType: 'json' property from the object literal...
Method Two
Or you can do what @Sagiv was saying by returning your data as Json.
The reason why this parserror message occurs is that when you simply return a string or another value, it is not really Json, so the parser fails when parsing it.
So if you remove the dataType: json property, it will not try to parse it as Json. 
With the other method if you make sure to return your data as Json, the parser will know how to handle it properly.

is not suitable.
I would try using RegEx, but since the guid can be parenthesis wrapped, brace wrapped, none wrapped, makes it hard. 
Additionally, I thought certain Guid values are invalid(?)

Update 1
ChristianK had a good idea to catch only FormatException, rather than all. Changed the question's code sample to include suggestion.

Update 2
Why worry about thrown exceptions? Am I really expecting invalid GUIDs all that often? 
The answer is yes. That is why I am using TryStrToGuid - I am expecting bad data.
Example 1 Namespace extensions can be specified by appending a GUID to a folder name. I might be parsing folder names, checking to see if the text after the final . is a GUID.
c:\Program Files
c:\Program Files.old
c:\Users
c:\Users.old
c:\UserManager.{CE7F5AA5-6832-43FE-BAE1-80D14CD8F666}
c:\Windows
c:\Windows.old

Example 2 I might be running a heavily used web-server wants to check the validity of some posted back data. I don't want invalid data tying up resources 2-3 orders of magnitude higher than it needs to be.
Example 3 I might be parsing a search expression entered by a user. 

If they enter GUID's I want to process them specially (such as specifically searching for that object, or highlight and format that specific search term in the response text.)

The heart of a TestRule is the base.evaluate(), which calls your test method. So around this call you put a retry loop. If an exception is thrown in your test method (an assertion failure is actually an AssertionError), then the test has failed, and you'll retry.
There is one other thing that may be of use. You may only want to apply this retry logic to a set of tests, in which case you can add into the Retry class above a test for a particular annotation on the method. Description contains a list of annotations for the method. For more information about this, see my answer to How to run some code before each JUnit @Test method individually, without using @RunWith nor AOP?.

Background: I have a large Set of Selenium2-WebDriver tests written with JUnit. Due to a very aggressive timing (only short wait periods after the clicks) some tests (1 out of 100, and always a different one) can fail because the server sometimes responds a bit slower. But I can not make the wait period so long that it is definitely long enough, because then the tests will take for ever.) -- So I think it is acceptable for this use case that a test is green even if it needs a second try.
Of course it would be better to have a 2 out of 3 majority (repeat a failing test 3 times, and take them as correct, if two of the tests are correct), but this would be a future improvement.

5573741,134554.0,2011-04-06 22:29:20+00:00,5573310,78,"First, some standardese:

6.7.5.3 Function declarators (including prototypes)
...
7 A declaration of a parameter as ââarray of typeââ shall be adjusted to ââqualified pointer to
typeââ, where the type qualifiers (if any) are those specified within the [ and ] of the
array type derivation. If the keyword static also appears within the [ and ] of the
array type derivation, then for each call to the function, the value of the corresponding
actual argument shall provide access to the first element of an array with at least as many
elements as specified by the size expression.

So, in short, any function parameter declared as T a[] or T a[N] is treated as though it were declared T *a.  
So, why are array parameters treated as though they were declared as pointers?  Here's why:

6.3.2.1 Lvalues, arrays, and function designators
...
3 Except when it is the operand of the sizeof operator or the unary & operator, or is a
string literal used to initialize an array, an expression that has type ââarray of typeââ is
converted to an expression with type ââpointer to typeââ that points to the initial element of
the array object and is not an lvalue. If the array object has register storage class, the
behavior is undefined.

Given the following code:
int main(void)
{
  int arr[10];
  foo(arr);
  ...
}

In the call to foo, the array expression arr isn't an operand of either sizeof or &, so its type is implicitly converted from ""10-element array of int"" to ""pointer to int"" according to 6.2.3.1/3. Thus, foo will receive a pointer value, rather than an array value.  
Because of 6.7.5.3/7, you can write foo as
void foo(int a[]) // or int a[10]
{
  ...
}

but it will be interpreted as 
void foo(int *a)
{
  ...
}

Thus, the two forms are identical.  
The last sentence in 6.7.5.3/7 was introduced with C99, and basically means that if you have a parameter declaration like
void foo(int a[static 10])
{
  ...
}

the actual parameter corresponding to a must be an array with at least 10 elements.

Is there a way to increase this size of memory an application can use?

Applications running on API Level 11+ can have android:largeHeap=""true"" on the <application> element in the manifest to request a larger-than-normal heap size, and getLargeMemoryClass() on ActivityManager will tell you how big that heap is. However:

This only works on API Level 11+ (i.e., Honeycomb and beyond)
There is no guarantee how large the large heap will be
The user will perceive your large-heap request, because it will force their other apps out of RAM terminate other apps' processes to free up system RAM for use by your large heap
Because of #3, and the fact that I expect that android:largeHeap will be abused, support for this may be abandoned in the future, or the user may be warned about this at install time (e.g., you will need to request a special permission for it)
Presently, this feature is lightly documented

29717211,3925941.0,2015-04-18 12:15:44+00:00,29717210,63,"It is almost always unnecessary to check if an optional is not nil.  Pretty much the only time you need to do this is if its nil-ness is the only thing you want to know about â you donât care whatâs in the value, just that itâs not nil.
Under most other circumstances, there is a bit of Swift shorthand that can more safely and concisely do the task inside the if for you.
Using the value if it isnât nil
Instead of:
let s = ""1""
let i = Int(s)

if i != nil {
    print(i! + 1)
}

you can use if let:
if let i = Int(s) {
    print(i + 1)
}

You can also use var:
if var i = Int(s) {
    print(++i)  // prints 2
}

but note that i will be a local copy - any changes to i will not affect the value inside the original optional.
You can unwrap multiple optionals within a single if let, and later ones can depend on earlier ones:
if let url = NSURL(string: urlString),
       data = NSData(contentsOfURL: url),
       image = UIImage(data: data)
{
    let view = UIImageView(image: image)
    // etc.
}

You can also add where clauses to the unwrapped values:
if let url = NSURL(string: urlString) where url.pathExtension == ""png"",
   let data = NSData(contentsOfURL: url), image = UIImage(data: data)
{ etc. }

Replacing nil with a default
Instead of:
let j: Int
if i != nil {
    j = i
}
else {
    j = 0
}

or:
let j = i != nil ? i! : 0

you can use the nil-coalescing operator, ??:
// j will be the unwrapped value of i,
// or 0 if i is nil
let j = i ?? 0

Equating an optional with a non-optional
Instead of:
if i != nil && i! == 2 {
    print(""i is two and not nil"")
}

you can check if optionals are equal to non-optional values:
if i == 2 {
    print(""i is two and not nil"")
}

This also works with comparisons:
if i < 5 { }

nil is always equal to other nils, and is less than any non-nil value.
Be careful! There can be gotchas here:
let a: Any = ""hello""
let b: Any = ""goodbye""
if (a as? Double) == (b as? Double) {
    print(""these will be equal because both nil..."")
}

Calling a method (or reading a property) on an optional
Instead of:
let j: Int
if i != nil {
    j = i.successor()
}
else {
   // no reasonable action to take at this point
   fatalError(""no idea what to do now..."")
}

you can use optional chaining, ?.:
let j = i?.successor()

Note, j will also now be optional, to account for the fatalError scenario.  Later, you can use one of the other techniques in this answer to handle jâs optionality, but you can often defer actually unwrapping your optionals until much later, or sometimes not at all.
As the name implies, you can chain them, so you can write:
let j = s.toInt()?.successor()?.successor()

Optional chaining also works with subscripts:
let dictOfArrays: [""nine"": [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7]]
let sevenOfNine = dictOfArrays[""nine""]?[7]  // returns {Some 7}

and functions:
let dictOfFuncs: [String:(Int,Int)->Int] = [
      ""add"":(+),
      ""subtract"":(-)
]

dictOfFuncs[""add""]?(1,1)  // returns {Some 2}

Assigning to a property on an optional
Instead of:
if splitViewController != nil {
    splitViewController!.delegate = self 
}

you can assign through an optional chain:
splitViewController?.delegate = self

Only if splitViewController is non-nil will the assignment happen.
Using the value if it isnât nil, or bailing (new in Swift 2.0)
Sometimes in a function, thereâs a short bit of code you want to write to check an optional, and if itâs nil, exit the function early, otherwise keep going.
You might write this like this:
func f(s: String) {
    let i = Int(s)
    if i == nil { fatalError(""Input must be a number"") }
    print(i! + 1)
}

or to avoid the force unwrap, like this:
func f(s: String) {
    if let i = Int(s) {
        print(i! + 1)
    }
    else { 
        fatalErrr(""Input must be a number"")
    }
}

but itâs much nicer to keep the error-handling code at the top by the check.  This can also lead to unpleasant nesting (the ""pyramid of doom"").
Instead you can use guard, which is like an if not let:
func f(s: String) {
    guard let i = Int(s)
        else { fatalError(""Input must be a number"") }

    // i will be an non-optional Int
    print(i+1)
}

The else part must exit the scope of the guarded value, e.g. a return or fatalError, to guarantee that the guarded value will be valid for the remainder of the scope.
guard isnât limited to function scope.  For example the following:
var a = [""0"",""1"",""foo"",""2""]
while !a.isEmpty  {
    guard let i = Int(a.removeLast())
        else { continue }

    print(i+1, appendNewline: false)
}

prints 321.
Looping over non-nil items in a sequence (new in Swift 2.0)
If you have a sequence of optionals, you can use for case let _? to iterate over all the non-optional elements:
let a = [""0"",""1"",""foo"",""2""]
for case let i? in a.map({ Int($0)}) {
    print(i+1, appendNewline: false)
}

prints 321.  This is using the pattern-matching syntax for an optional, which is a variable name followed by ?.
You can also use this pattern matching in switch statements:
func add(i: Int?, _ j: Int?) -> Int? {
    switch (i,j) {
    case (nil,nil), (_?,nil), (nil,_?):
        return nil
    case let (x?,y?):
        return x + y
    }
}

add(1,2)    // 3
add(nil, 1) // nil

Looping until a function returns nil
Much like if let, you can also write while let and loop until nil:
while let line = readLine() {
    print(line)
}

You can also write while var (similar caveats to if var apply).
where clauses also work here (and terminate the loop, rather than skipping):
while let line = readLine() 
where !line.isEmpty {
    print(line)
}

Passing an optional into a function that takes a non-optional and returns a result
Instead of:
let j: Int
if i != nil {
    j = abs(i!)
}
else {
   // no reasonable action to take at this point
   fatalError(""no idea what to do now..."")
}

you can use optionalâs map operator:
let j = i.map { abs($0) }

This is very similar to optional chaining, but for when you need to pass the non-optional value into the function as an argument.  As with optional chaining, the result will be optional.
This is nice when you want an optional anyway.  For example, reduce1 is like reduce, but uses the first value as the seed, returning an optional in case the array is empty.  You might write it like this (using the guard keyword from earlier):
extension Array {
    func reduce1(combine: (T,T)->T)->T? {

        guard let head = self.first
            else { return nil }

        return dropFirst(self).reduce(head, combine: combine)
    }
}

[1,2,3].reduce1(+) // returns 6

But instead you could map the .first property, and return that:
extension Array {
    func reduce1(combine: (T,T)->T)->T? {
        return self.first.map {
            dropFirst(self).reduce($0, combine: combine)
        }
    }
}

Passing an optional into a function that takes an optional and returns a result, avoiding annoying double-optionals
Sometimes, you want something similar to map, but the function you want to call itself returns an optional.  For example:
// an array of arrays
let arr = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6]]
// .first returns an optional of the first element of the array
// (optional because the array could be empty, in which case it's nil)
let fst = arr.first  // fst is now [Int]?, an optional array of ints
// now, if we want to find the index of the value 2, we could use map and find
let idx = fst.map { find($0, 2) }

But now idx is of type Int??, a double-optional.  Instead, you can use flatMap, which âflattensâ the result into a single optional:
let idx = fst.flatMap { find($0, 2) }
// idx will be of type Int? 
// and not Int?? unlike if `map` was used

if someOptional != nil {
    // do something with the unwrapped someOptional e.g.       
    someFunction(someOptional!)
}

This seems a bit verbose, and also I hear that using the ! force unwrap operator can be unsafe and best avoided.  Is there a better way to handle this?

myApp.controller('DemoController', ['clientId', function DemoController(clientId) {

The same thing can be achieved using a Provider, Factory, or Service since they are ""just syntactic sugar on top of a provider recipe"" but using Value will achieve what you want with minimal syntax.
The other option is to use $rootScope, but it's not really an option because you shouldn't use it for the same reasons you shouldn't use global variables in other languages. It's advised to be used sparingly.
Since all scopes inherit from $rootScope, if you have a variable $rootScope.data and someone forgets that data is already defined and creates $scope.data in a local scope you will run into problems.

If you want to modify this value and have it persist across all your controllers, use an object and modify the properties keeping in mind Javascript is pass by ""copy of a reference"":

For example, if free needed the size of the memory block, then strdup would somehow have to return two values (pointer + size) instead of one (pointer), and C makes multiple-value returns much more cumbersome than single-value returns. Instead of char *strdup(char *) we'd have to write char *strdup(char *, size_t *) or else struct CharPWithSize { char *val; size_t size}; CharPWithSize strdup(char *). (Nowadays that second option looks pretty tempting, because we know that NUL-terminated strings are the ""most catastrophic design bug in the history of computing"", but that's hindsight speaking. Back in the 70's, C's ability to handle strings as a simple char * was actually considered a defining advantage over competitors like Pascal and Algol.) Plus, it isn't just strdup that suffers from this problem -- it affects every system- or user-defined function which allocates heap memory.
The early Unix designers were very clever people, and there are many reasons why free is better than mfree so basically I think the answer to the question is that they noticed this and designed their system accordingly. I doubt you'll find any direct record of what was going on inside their heads at the moment they made that decision. But we can imagine.
Pretend that you're writing applications in C to run on V6 Unix, with its two-argument mfree. You've managed okay so far, but keeping track of these pointer sizes is becoming more and more of a hassle as your programs become more ambitious and require more and more use of heap allocated variables. But then you have a brilliant idea: instead of copying around these size_ts all the time, you can just write some utility functions, which stash the size directly inside the allocated memory:
void *my_alloc(size_t size) {
    void *block = malloc(sizeof(size) + size);
    *(size_t *)block = size;
    return (void *) ((size_t *)block + 1);
}
void my_free(void *block) {
    block = (size_t *)block - 1;
    mfree(block, *(size_t *)block);
}

And the more code you write using these new functions, the more awesome they seem. Not only do they make your code easier to write, they also make your code faster -- two things which don't often go together! Before you were passing these size_ts around all over the place, which added CPU overhead for the copying, and meant you had to spill registers more often (esp. for the extra function arguments), and wasted memory (since nested function calls will often result in multiple copies of the size_t being stored in different stack frames). In your new system, you still have to spend the memory to store the size_t, but only once, and it never gets copied anywhere. These may seem like small efficiencies, but keep in mind that we're talking about high-end machines with 256 KiB of RAM.
This makes you happy! So you share your cool trick with the bearded men who are working on the next Unix release, but it doesn't make them happy, it makes them sad. You see, they were just in the process of adding a bunch of new utility functions like strdup, and they realize that people using your cool trick won't be able to use their new functions, because their new functions all use the cumbersome pointer+size API. And then that makes you sad too, because you realize you'll have to rewrite the good strdup(char *) function yourself in every program you write, instead of being able to use the system version.
But wait! This is 1977, and backwards compatibility won't be invented for another 5 years! And besides, no-one serious actually uses this obscure ""Unix"" thing with its off-color name. The first edition of K&R is on its way to the publisher now, but that's no problem -- it says right on the first page that ""C provides no operations to deal directly with composite objects such as character strings... there is no heap..."". At this point in history, string.h and malloc are vendor extensions (!). So, suggests Bearded Man #1, we can change them however we like; why don't we just declare your tricky allocator to be the official allocator?
A few days later, Bearded Man #2 sees the new API and says hey, wait, this is better than before, but it's still spending an entire word per allocation storing the size. He views this as the next thing to blasphemy. Everyone else looks at him like he's crazy, because what else can you do? That night he stays late and invents a new allocator that doesn't store the size at all, but instead infers it on the fly by performing black magic bitshifts on the pointer value, and swaps it in while keeping the new API in place. The new API means that no-one notices the switch, but they do notice that the next morning the compiler uses 10% less RAM.
And now everyone's happy: You get your easier-to-write and faster code, Bearded Man #1 gets to write a nice simple strdup that people will actually use, and Bearded Man #2 -- confident that he's earned his keep for a bit -- goes back to messing around with quines. Ship it!
Or at least, that's how it could have happened.
",24203940,605922.0,2014-06-13 11:10:25+00:00,,72,Why does `free` in C not take the number of bytes to be freed?,"Just to be clear: I do know that malloc and free are implemented in the C library, which usually allocates chunks of memory from the OS and does its own management to parcel out smaller lots of memory to the application and keeps track of the number of bytes allocated.  This question is not How does free know how much to free.
Rather, I want to know why free was made this way in the first place. Being a low-level language, I think it would be perfectly reasonable to ask a C programmer to keep track not only of what memory was allocated but how much (in fact, I commonly find that I end up keeping track of the number of bytes malloced anyway). It also occurs to me that explicitly giving the number of bytes to free might allow for some performance optimisations, e.g. an allocator that has separate pools for different allocation sizes would be able to determine which pool to free from just by looking at the input arguments, and there would be less space overhead overall.
So, in short, why were malloc and free created such that they're required to internally keep track of the number of bytes allocated? Is it just a historical accident?
A small edit:
A few people have provided points like ""what if you free a different amount than what you allocated"". My imagined API could simply require one to free exactly the number of bytes allocated; freeing more or less could simply be UB or implementation defined. I don't want to discourage discussion about other possibilities, though.

Unchecked exceptions are meant to represent a bug in your code, an unexpected situation that you might not be able to recover from. A NullPointerException is a classical example. Those exceptions are subclasses of RuntimeException

Checked exception must be handled by the calling method, either by catching it and acting accordingly, or by throwing it to the calling method. Unchecked exceptions are not meant to be caught, even though it is possible to do so.

I did quite a bit of interviewing last year, and for my part of the interview I was supposed to test the way people thought, and how they implemented simple-to-moderate algorithms on a white board. I'd initially started out with questions like:

Given that Pi can be estimated using the function 4 * (1 - 1/3 + 1/5 - 1/7 + ...) with more terms giving greater accuracy, write a function that calculates Pi to an accuracy of 5 decimal places.

It's a problem that should make you think, but shouldn't be out of reach to a seasoned developer (it can be answered in about 10 lines of C#). However, many of our (supposedly pre-screened by the agency) candidates couldn't even begin to answer it, or even explain how they might go about answering it. So after a while I started asking simpler questions like:

Given the area of a circle is given by Pi times the radius squared, write a function to calculate the area of a circle.

Amazingly, more than half the candidates couldn't write this function in any language (I can read most popular languages so I let them use any language of their choice, including pseudo-code). We had ""C# developers"" who could not write this function in C#.
I was surprised by this. I had always thought that developers should be able to write code. It seems that, nowadays, this is a controversial opinion. Certainly it is amongst interview candidates!

Edit:
There's a lot of discussion in the comments about whether the first question is a good or bad one, and whether you should ask questions as complex as this in an interview. I'm not going to delve into this here (that's a whole new question) apart from to say you're largely missing the point of the post. 
Yes, I said people couldn't make any headway with this, but the second question is trivial and many people couldn't make any headway with that one either! Anybody who calls themselves a developer should be able to write the answer to the second one in a few seconds without even thinking. And many can't.

The idea for this question came from the comment thread from my answer to the ""What are five things you hate about your favorite language?"" question. I contended that classes in C# should be sealed by default - I won't put my reasoning in the question, but I might write a fuller explanation as an answer to this question. I was surprised at the heat of the discussion in the comments (25 comments currently).
So, what contentious opinions do you hold? I'd rather avoid the kind of thing which ends up being pretty religious with relatively little basis (e.g. brace placing) but examples might include things like ""unit testing isn't actually terribly helpful"" or ""public fields are okay really"". The important thing (to me, anyway) is that you've got reasons behind your opinions.

Use JNI and crash in the native code.
If no security manager is installed you can use reflection to crash the VM. This is VM specific, but normally a VM stores a bunch of pointers to native resources in private fields (e.g. a pointer to the native thread object is stored in a long field in java.lang.Thread). Just change them via reflection and the VM will crash sooner or later.
All VMs have bugs, so you just have to trigger one.

For the last method I have a short example, which will crash a Sun Hotspot VM quiet nicely:
public class Crash {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Object[] o = null;

        while (true) {

The GCC compiler flags that control unused warnings include:
-Wunused-function
-Wunused-label
-Wunused-parameter
-Wunused-value
-Wunused-variable
-Wunused (=all of the above)

Each of these has a corresponding negative form with ""no-"" inserted after the W which turns off the warning (in case it was turned on by -Wall, for example). Thus, in your case you should use
-Wno-unused-function

Of course this works for the whole code, not just compile-time asserts. For function-specific behaviour, have a look at Function attributes.

Check carefully the error message: Django's test runner tries to import the tests from mydjango.polls.tests where mydjango is the name of the root directory (the container for your project).
I fixed this issue by deleting the __init__.py file in mydjango directory (at the same level than manage.py file). This directory is not supposed to be a python module and it seems to mess up with Django's test runner if it is the case.
So just deleting the _init_.py file should fix our problem:

import datetime
from django.utils import timezone
from polls.models import Question

# Create your tests here.l  
class QuestionMethodTests(TestCase):

    def test_was_published_recently_with_future_poll(self):

        future_question = Question(pub_date=timezone.now() + datetime.timedelta(hours=50))
        self.assertEqual(future_question.was_published_recently(), False)

then i installed unittest2 into the virtualenv with
$pip install unittest2

20566735,746736.0,2013-12-13 12:37:31+00:00,20566660,104,"Something like this should do it:

.column-right{ float: right; width: 33%; }

DEMO
EDIT
To do this with a larger number of columns you could build a very simple grid system. For example, something like this should work for a five column layout:


.column {
    float: left;
    position: relative;
    width: 20%;
  
    /*for demo purposes only */
    background: #f2f2f2;

}
.column-offset-2 {
    left: 40%;
}
.column-offset-3 {
    left: 60%;
}
.column-offset-4 {
    left: 80%;
}

.column-inset-1 {
    left: -20%;
}
.column-inset-2 {
    left: -40%;
}
.column-inset-3 {

.column-inset-4 {
    left: -80%;
}

   <div class=""column column-two column-inset-1"">Column two</div>

   <div class=""column column-four column-inset-2"">Column four</div>
   <div class=""column column-five"">Column five</div>
</div>



Or, if you are lucky enough to be able to support only modern browsers, you can use flexible boxes:


.container {
    display: flex;
}

.column {
    flex: 1;
    
    /*for demo purposes only */
    background: #f2f2f2;

}
.column-two {
    order: 1;
}
.column-three {
    order: 4;
}
.column-four {
    order: 2;
}
.column-five {
    order: 5;
}

16022085,788207.0,2013-04-15 18:18:50+00:00,16015020,77,"F-algebras and F-coalgebras are mathematical structures which are instrumental in reasoning about inductive types (or recursive types).
F-algebras
We'll start first with F-algebras. I will try to be as simple as possible.
I guess you know what is a recursive type. For example, this is a type for a list of integers:
data IntList = Nil | Cons (Int, IntList)

It is obvious that it is recursive - indeed, its definition refers to itself. Its definition consists of two data constructors, which have the following types:
Nil  :: () -> IntList
Cons :: (Int, IntList) -> IntList

Note that I have written type of Nil as () -> IntList, not simply IntList. These are in fact equivalent types from the theoretical point of view, because () type has only one inhabitant.
If we write signatures of these functions in a more set-theoretical way, we will get
Nil  :: 1 -> IntList
Cons :: Int Ã IntList -> IntList

where 1 is a unit set (set with one element) and A Ã B operation is a cross product of two sets A and B (that is, set of pairs (a, b) where a goes through all elements of A and b goes through all elements of B).
Disjoint union of two sets A and B is a set A | B which is a union of sets {(a, 1) : a in A} and {(b, 2) : b in B}. Essentially it is a set of all elements from both A and B, but with each of this elements 'marked' as belonging to either A or B, so when we pick any element from A | B we will immediately know whether this element came from A or from B.
We can 'join' Nil and Cons functions, so they will form a single function working on a set 1 | (Int Ã IntList):
Nil|Cons :: 1 | (Int Ã IntList) -> IntList

Indeed, if Nil|Cons function is applied to () value (which, obviously, belongs to 1 | (Int Ã IntList) set), then it behaves as if it was Nil; if Nil|Cons is applied to any value of type (Int, IntList) (such values are also in the set 1 | (Int Ã IntList), it behaves as Cons.
Now consider another datatype:
data IntTree = Leaf Int | Branch (IntTree, IntTree)

It has the following constructors:
Leaf   :: Int -> IntTree
Branch :: (IntTree, IntTree) -> IntTree

which also can be joined into one function:
Leaf|Branch :: Int | (IntTree Ã IntTree) -> IntTree

It can be seen that both of this joined functions have similar type: they both look like
f :: F T -> T

where F is a kind of transformation which takes our type and gives more complex type, which consists of x and | operations, usages of T and possibly other types. For example, for IntList and IntTree F looks as follows:
F1 T = 1 | (Int Ã T)
F2 T = Int | (T Ã T)

We can immediately notice that any algebraic type can be written in this way. Indeed, that is why they are called 'algebraic': they consist of a number of 'sums' (unions) and 'products' (cross products) of other types.
Now we can define F-algebra. F-algebra is just a pair (T, f), where T is some type and f is a function of type f :: F T -> T. In our examples F-algebras are (IntList, Nil|Cons) and (IntTree, Leaf|Branch). Note, however, that despite that type of f function is the same for each F, T and f themselves can be arbitrary. For example, (String, g :: 1 | (Int x String) -> String) or (Double, h :: Int | (Double, Double) -> Double) for some g and h are also F-algebras for corresponding F.
Afterwards we can introduce F-algebra homomorphisms and then initial F-algebras, which have very useful properties. In fact, (IntList, Nil|Cons) is an initial F1-algebra, and (IntTree, Leaf|Branch) is an initial F2-algebra. I will not present exact definitions of these terms and properties since they are more complex and abstract than needed.
Nonetheless, the fact that, say, (IntList, Nil|Cons) is F-algebra allows us to define fold-like function on this type. As you know, fold is a kind of operation which transforms some recursive datatype in one finite value. For example, we can fold a list of integer into a single value which is a sum of all elements in the list:
foldr (+) 0 [1, 2, 3, 4] -> 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10

It is possible to generalize such operation on any recursive datatype.
The following is a signature of foldr function:
foldr :: ((a -> b -> b), b) -> [a] -> b

Note that I have used braces to separate first two arguments from the last one. This is not real foldr function, but it is isomorphic to it (that is, you can easily get one from the other and vice versa). Partially applied foldr will have the following signature:
foldr ((+), 0) :: [Int] -> Int

We can see that this is a function which takes a list of integers and returns a single integer. Let's define such function in terms of our IntList type.
sumFold :: IntList -> Int
sumFold Nil         = 0
sumFold (Cons x xs) = x + sumFold xs

We see that this function consists of two parts: first part defines this function's behavior on Nil part of IntList, and second part defines function's behavior on Cons part.
Now suppose that we are programming not in Haskell but in some language which allows usage of algebraic types directly in type signatures (well, technically Haskell allows usage of algebraic types via tuples and Either a b datatype, but this will lead to unnecessary verbosity). Consider a function:
reductor :: () | (Int Ã Int) -> Int
reductor ()     = 0
reductor (x, s) = x + s

It can be seen that reductor is a function of type F1 Int -> Int, just as in definition of F-algebra! Indeed, the pair (Int, reductor) is an F1-algebra.
Because IntList is an initial F1-algebra, for each type T and for each function r :: F1 T -> T there exist a function, called catamorphism for r, which converts IntList to T, and such function is unique. Indeed, in our example a catamorphism for reductor is sumFold. Note how reductor and sumFold are similar: they have almost the same structure! In reductor definition s parameter usage (type of which corresponds to T) corresponds to usage of the result of computation of sumFold xs in sumFold definition.
Just to make it more clear and help you see the pattern, here is another example, and we again begin from the resulting folding function. Consider append function which appends its first argument to second one:
(append [4, 5, 6]) [1, 2, 3] = (foldr (:) [4, 5, 6]) [1, 2, 3] -> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

This how it looks on our IntList:
appendFold :: IntList -> IntList -> IntList
appendFold ys ()          = ys
appendFold ys (Cons x xs) = x : appendFold ys xs

Again, let's try to write out the reductor:
appendReductor :: IntList -> () | (Int Ã IntList) -> IntList
appendReductor ys ()      = ys
appendReductor ys (x, rs) = x : rs

appendFold is a catamorphism for appendReductor which transforms IntList into IntList.
So, essentially, F-algebras allow us to define 'folds' on recursive datastructures, that is, operations which reduce our structures to some value.
F-coalgebras
F-coalgebras are so-called 'dual' term for F-algebras. They allow us to define unfolds for recursive datatypes, that is, a way to construct recursive structures from some value.
Suppose you have the following type:
data IntStream = Cons (Int, IntStream)

This is an infinite stream of integers. Its only constructor has the following type:
Cons :: (Int, IntStream) -> IntStream

Or, in terms of sets
Cons :: Int Ã IntStream -> IntStream

Haskell allows you to pattern match on data constructors, so you can define the following functions working on IntStreams:
head :: IntStream -> Int
head (Cons (x, xs)) = x

tail :: IntStream -> IntStream
tail (Cons (x, xs)) = xs

You can naturally 'join' these functions into single function of type IntStream -> Int Ã IntStream:
head&tail :: IntStream -> Int Ã IntStream
head&tail (Cons (x, xs)) = (x, xs)

Notice how the result of the function coincides with algebraic representation of our IntStream type. Similar thing can also be done for other recursive data types. Maybe you already have noticed the pattern. I'm referring to a family of functions of type
g :: T -> F T

where T is some type. From now on we will define
F1 T = Int Ã T

Now, F-coalgebra is a pair (T, g), where T is a type and g is a function of type g :: T -> F T. For example, (IntStream, head&tail) is an F1-coalgebra. Again, just as in F-algebras, g and T can be arbitrary, for example,(String, h :: String -> Int x String) is also an F1-coalgebra for some h.
Among all F-coalgebras there are so-called terminal F-coalgebras, which are dual to initial F-algebras. For example, IntStream is a terminal F-coalgebra. This means that for every type T and for every function p :: T -> F1 T there exist a function, called anamorphism, which converts T to IntStream, and such function is unique.
Consider the following function, which generates a stream of successive integers starting from the given one:
nats :: Int -> IntStream
nats n = Cons (n, nats (n+1))

Now let's inspect a function natsBuilder :: Int -> F1 Int, that is, natsBuilder :: Int -> Int Ã Int:
natsBuilder :: Int -> Int Ã Int
natsBuilder n = (n, n+1)

Again, we can see some similarity between nats and natsBuilder. It is very similar to the connection we have observed with reductors and folds earlier. nats is an anamorphism for natsBuilder.
Another example, a function which takes a value and a function and returns a stream of successive applications of the function to the value:
iterate :: (Int -> Int) -> Int -> IntStream
iterate f n = Cons (n, iterate f (f n))

Its builder function is the following one:
iterateBuilder :: (Int -> Int) -> Int -> Int Ã Int
iterateBuilder f n = (n, f n)

Then iterate is an anamorphism for iterateBuilder.
Conclusion
So, in short, F-algebras allow to define folds, that is, operations which reduce recursive structure down into a single value, and F-coalgebras allow to do the opposite: construct a [potentially] infinite structure from a single value.
In fact in Haskell F-algebras and F-coalgebras coincide. This is a very nice property which is a consequence of presence of 'bottom' value in each type. So in Haskell both folds and unfolds can be created for every recursive type. However, theoretical model behind this is more complex than the one I have presented above, so I deliberately have avoided it.
Hope this helps.

The code is following:
private byte[] aesEncryptedInfo(String info) throws UnsupportedEncodingException, IllegalBlockSizeException, BadPaddingException, InvalidKeyException, NoSuchAlgorithmException, NoSuchPaddingException, InvalidParameterSpecException, InvalidAlgorithmParameterException, NoSuchProviderException {
    Security.addProvider(new BouncyCastleProvider());
    SecretKey secret = new SecretKeySpec(CUSTOMLONGSECRETKEY.substring(0, 32).getBytes(), ""AES"");
    Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance(""AES/CBC/PKCS7Padding"", ""BC"");
    cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, secret, new IvParameterSpec(VECTOR_SECRET_KEY.getBytes()));
    return cipher.doFinal(info.getBytes(""UTF-8""));
}

UPDATE
Looks like according to the selected answer I have to modify something on my TeamCity installation and it will possibly affect some user installations - so its not a good choice I have to switch to another crypto library to do that without limitations. So probably bouncy castle will help.
UPDATE 2
I actually switched to use BouncyCastle to avoid this limitation. Note this only works if you use own BC classes directly, not the BC provider.

405820,14860.0,2009-01-02 01:34:08+00:00,405770,110,"In my opinion, I don't believe it's the job of the compiler to fix what is, honestly, bad coding. You have, quite explicitly, told the compiler you want that first loop executed. It's the same as:
x = 0
sleep 6 // Let's assume this is defined somewhere.
print x

I wouldn't want the compiler removing my sleep statement just because it did nothing. You may argue that the sleep statement is an explicit request for a delay whereas your example is not. But then you will be allowing the compiler to make very high-level decisions about what your code should do, and I believe that to be a bad thing.
Code, and the compiler that processes it, are tools and you need to be a tool-smith if you want to use them effectively. How many 12"" chainsaws will refuse to try cut down a 30"" tree? How many drills will automatically switch to hammer mode if they detect a concrete wall?
None, I suspect, and this is because the cost of designing this into the product would be horrendous for a start. But, more importantly, you shouldn't be using drills or chainsaws if you don't know what you're doing. For example: if you don't know what kickback is (a very easy way for a newbie to take off their arm), stay away from chainsaws until you do.
I'm all for allowing compilers to suggest improvements but I'd rather maintain the control myself. It should not be up to the compiler to decide unilaterally that a loop is unnecessary.
For example, I've done timing loops in embedded systems where the clock speed of the CPU is known exactly but no reliable timing device is available. In that case, you can calculate precisely how long a given loop will take and use that to control how often things happen. That wouldn't work if the compiler (or assembler in that case) decided my loop was useless and optimized it out of existence.
Having said that, let me leave you with an old story of a VAX FORTRAN compiler that was undergoing a benchmark for performance and it was found that it was many orders of magnitude faster than its nearest competitor.
It turns out the compiler noticed that the result of the benchmark loops weren't being used anywhere else and optimized the loops into oblivion.
",405770,48181.0,2009-01-02 01:01:36+00:00,,34,Why are compilers so stupid?,"I always wonder why compilers can't figure out simple things that are obvious to the human eye. They do lots of simple optimizations, but never something even a little bit complex. For example, this code takes about 6 seconds on my computer to print the value zero (using java 1.6):
int x = 0;
for (int i = 0; i < 100 * 1000 * 1000 * 1000; ++i) {
    x += x + x + x + x + x;
}
System.out.println(x);

It is totally obvious that x is never changed so no matter how often you add 0 to itself it stays zero. So the compiler could in theory replace this with System.out.println(0).
Or even better, this takes 23 seconds:
public int slow() {
    String s = ""x"";
    for (int i = 0; i < 100000; ++i) {
        s += ""x"";
    }
    return 10;
}

First the compiler could notice that I am actually creating a string s of 100000 ""x"" so it could automatically use s StringBuilder instead, or even better directly replace it with the resulting string as it is always the same. Second, It does not recognize that I do not actually use the string at all, so the whole loop could be discarded!
Why, after so much manpower is going into fast compilers, are they still so relatively dumb?
EDIT: Of course these are stupid examples that should never be used anywhere. But whenever I have to rewrite a beautiful and very readable code into something unreadable so that the compiler is happy and produces fast code, I wonder why compilers or some other automated tool can't do this work for me.

If a GPU device has, for example, 4 multiprocessing units, and they can run  768 threads each: then at a given moment no more than 4*768 threads will be really running in parallel (if you planned more threads, they will be waiting their turn).
Software
threads are organized in blocks. A block is executed by a multiprocessing unit.
The threads of a block can be indentified (indexed) using 1Dimension(x), 2Dimensions (x,y) or 3Dim indexes (x,y,z) but in any case x*y*z <= 768 for our example (other restriccions apply to x,y,z, see the guide and your device capability).
Obviously, if you need more than those 4*768 threads you need more than 4 blocks.
Blocks may be also indexed 1D, 2D or 3D. There is a queue of blocks waiting to enter
the GPU (because, in our example, the GPU has 4 multiprocessors and only 4 blocks are
being executed simultaneously).
Now a simple case: processing a 512x512 image
Suppose we want one thread to process one pixel (i,j).
We can use blocks of 64 threads each. Then we need 512*512/64 = 4096 blocks
(so to have 512x512 threads = 4096*64)
It's common to organize (to make indexing the image easier) the threads in 2D blocks having blockDim = 8 x 8 (the 64 threads per block).  I prefer to call it threadsPerBlock.
dim3 threadsPerBlock(8, 8);  // 64 threads

and 2D gridDim = 64 x 64 blocks (the 4096 blocks needed). I prefer to call it numBlocks.
dim3 numBlocks(imageWidth/threadsPerBlock.x,  /* for instance 512/8 = 64*/
              imageHeight/threadsPerBlock.y); 

The kernel is launched like this:
myKernel <<<numBlocks,threadsPerBlock>>>( /* params for the kernel function */ );       

Finally: there will be something like ""a queue of 4096 blocks"", where a block is waiting to be assigned one of the multiprocessors of the GPU to get its 64 threads executed.
In the kernel the pixel (i,j) to be processed by a thread is calculated this way:
uint i = (blockIdx.x * blockDim.x) + threadIdx.x;
uint j = (blockIdx.y * blockDim.y) + threadIdx.y;

Information schema?
To find ""whether the table exists"" (no matter who's asking), querying the information schema (information_schema.tables) is incorrect, strictly speaking, because (per documentation):

Only those tables and views are shown that the current user has access
  to (by way of being the owner or having some privilege).

The query demonstrated by @kong can return FALSE, but the table can still exist. It answers the question:
How to check whether a table (or view) exists, and the current user has access to it?
SELECT EXISTS (
   SELECT 1
   FROM   information_schema.tables 
   WHERE  table_schema = 'schema_name'
   AND    table_name = 'table_name'
);

The information schema is mainly useful to stay portable across major versions and across different RDBMS. But the implementation is slow, because Postgres has to use sophisticated views to comply to the standard (information_schema.tables is a rather simple example). And some information (like OIDs) gets lost in translation from the system catalogs - which actually carry all information.
System catalogs
Your question was:
How to check whether a table exists?
SELECT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 
    FROM   pg_catalog.pg_class c
    JOIN   pg_catalog.pg_namespace n ON n.oid = c.relnamespace
    WHERE  n.nspname = 'schema_name'
    AND    c.relname = 'table_name'
    AND    c.relkind = 'r'    -- only tables(?)
);

Use the system catalogs pg_class and pg_namespace directly, which is also considerably faster. However, per documentation on pg_class:

The catalog pg_class catalogs tables and most everything else that has
  columns or is otherwise similar to a table. This includes indexes (but
  see also pg_index), sequences, views, materialized views, composite
  types, and TOAST tables;

Identifiers have to be unique among all of these objects. If you want to ask:
How to check whether a name for a table or similar object in a given schema is taken?
SELECT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 
    FROM   pg_catalog.pg_class c
    JOIN   pg_catalog.pg_namespace n ON n.oid = c.relnamespace
    WHERE  n.nspname = 'schema_name'
    AND    c.relname = 'table_name'
);

Alternative: cast to regclass
SELECT 'schema_name.table_name'::regclass

This raises an exception if the (optionally schema-qualified) table (or other object occupying that name) does not exist.
If you do not schema-qualify the table name, a cast to regclass defaults to the search_path and returns the OID for the first table found - or an exception if the table is in none of the listed schemas. Note that the system schemas pg_catalog and pg_temp* (the schema for temporary objects of the current session) are automatically part of the search_path.
You can use that and catch a possible exception in a function. Example:  

Check if sequence exists in Postgres (plpgsql)

A query like above avoids possible exceptions and is therefore slightly faster.
to_regclass(rel_name) in Postgres 9.4+
Much simpler now:
SELECT to_regclass('schema_name.table_name');

Same as the cast, but it returns ...

... null rather than throwing an error if the name is not found

{
    Sql(""UPDATE [dbo].[Movies] SET Title = 'No Title' WHERE Title IS NULL"");
    AlterColumn(""dbo.Movies"", ""Title"", c => c.String(nullable: false,defaultValue:""MyTitle""));

This is because AlterColumn produces DDL to set the default of the column to some specific value in the table specification. The DDL does not affect existing rows in the database.
You're actually making two changes at the same time (setting the default and making the column NOT NULL) and each of them is valid individually, but since you're making the two at the same time, you can expect the system to 'intelligently' realize your intent and set all NULL values to the default value, but this is not what's expected all the time.
Suppose you're only setting the default value for the column, and not making it NOT NULL. You obviously don't expect all the NULL records to be updated with the default you provide.
So, in my opinion, this is not a bug, and I don't want EF to update my data in the ways that I don't explicitly tell it to do. The developer is responsible to instruct the system about what to do with the data.

This is copied directly from an article I wrote in an internal company wiki:
Question: How to properly use closures in loops?
Quick answer: Use a function factory.
  for (var i=0;i<10;i++) {
    document.getElementById(i).onclick = (function(x){
      return function(){
        alert(x);
      }
    })(i);
  }

or the more easily readable version:
  function generateMyHandler (x) {
    return function(){
      alert(x);
    }
  }

  for (var i=0;i<10;i++) {
    document.getElementById(i).onclick = generateMyHandler(i);
  }

This often confuse people who are new to javascript or functional programming. It is a result of misunderstanding what closures are.
A closure does not merely pass the value of a variable or even a reference to the variable. A closure captures the variable itself! The following bit of code illustrates this:
  var message = 'Hello!';
  document.getElementById('foo').onclick = function(){alert(message)};
  message = 'Goodbye!';

Clicking the element 'foo' will generate an alert box with the message: ""Goodbye!"". Because of this, using a simple closure in a loop will end up with all closures sharing the same variable and that variable will contain the last value assigned to it in the loop. For example:
  for (var i=0;i<10;i++) {
    document.getElementById('something'+i).onclick = function(){alert(i)};
  }

All elements when clicked will generate an alert box with the number 9. In fact, if we now do i=""hello""; all elements will now generate a ""hello"" alert! The variable i is shared accross ten functions PLUS the current function/scope/context. Think of it as a sort of private global variable that only the functions involved can see.
What we want is an instance of that variable or at least a simple reference to the variable instead of the variable itself. Fortunately javascript already has a mechanism for passing a reference (for objects) or value (for strings and numbers): function arguments!
When a function is called in javascript the arguments to that function is passed by reference if it is an object or by value if it is a string or number. This is enough to break variable sharing in closures.
So:
  for (var i=0;i<10;i++) {
    document.getElementById(i).onclick =
      (function(x){ /* we use this function expression simply as a factory
                       to return the function we really want to use: */

        /* we want to return a function reference
           so we write a function expression*/
        return function(){
          alert(x); /* x here refers to the argument of the factory function
                       captured by the 'inner' closure */
        }

      /* The brace operators (..) evaluates an expression, in this case this
         function expression which yields a function reference. */

      })(i) /* The function reference generated is then immediately called()
               where the variable i is passed */
  }

var lastChar = id.substr(id.length - 1); // => ""1""

This gets the characters starting at id.length - 5 and, since the second argument for .substr() is omitted, continues to the end of the string.
If you're simply looking to find the characters after the underscore, you could use this:
var tabId = id.split(""_"").pop(); // => ""Tabs1""

This splits the string into an array on the underscore and then ""pops"" the last element off the array (which is the string you want).

Backward compatibility - Maven 3 is backward compatible, that is extremely important (especially for those who experienced the Maven 1 to Maven 2 transition). 
Versionless parent elements - Maven 3 will remove the need to specify the parent version in sub modules. THIS is great (in Maven 3.1).
Mixins - For POM composition (in Maven 3.1 AFAIK).
XML POM format using attributes - You can use attributes instead of elements.
Polyglot Maven - You can write your POM files now in different languages (I'm personally not annoyed by the XML format so I'm not sure I'll use this that often). 
Extensions points - To decorate the lifecycle or plugins (to hook behavior instead of extending plugins).
Queryable lifecycle - Decoupling of execution plans and execution.
Changes in the Plugin-API - This is more targeted at plugins developers (annotations instead of javadoc tags, extensions points, queryable lifecycle).
Better error and integrity reporting - Errors are more clear and linked to the Maven 3 wiki for a detailed explanation. Users will enjoy this.
Mercury - Complete rewrite of the artifact resolution system (which is now a dedicated product) Actually, Maven 3 uses Aether instead of Mercury.
Maven Embedder - This is great for IDEs and build tools (that can ""listen"" to the build process).
Incremental build support - especially useful for M2Eclipse (big performance boost).
Site and reporting extracted from Maven core - site doesn't work yet (will be fixed for the final release), reporting does (but you are invited to favor external quality tools like Sonar).
Maven shell - An optimized execution environment (Maven Shell is awesome).

To summarize, you're not totally wrong, there aren't that many changes at the surface (although I really enjoy the better error reporting and just can't wait for the version-less parent elements stuff). But the changes under the hood make Maven 3 much faster and this is huge. And I expect great innovations to happen with the new offered possibilities (yet to come though).  
At the end, the performance improvement is already enough to make it worth for me (building in less time is extremely valuable) and other things are bonuses. And since I'm not using the site plugin extensively, I'm already using Maven 3 for more than 4 months on some of my builds and I'm more than happy with it.

I couldn't even find the col-lg-push-x or pull classes in the original files for RC1 i downloaded, so check your bootstrap.css file. hopefully this is something they will sort out in RC2.

Also see This blog post on the subject

col-vp-push-x = push the column to the right by x number of columns, starting from where the column would normally render -> position: relative, on a vp or larger view-port.
col-vp-pull-x = pull the column to the left by x number of columns, starting from where the column would normally render -> position: relative, on a vp or larger view-port.
vp = xs, sm, md, or lg
x = 1 thru 12

I think what messes most people up, is that you need to change the order of the columns in your HTML markup (in the example below, B comes before A), and that it only does the pushing or pulling on view-ports that are greater than or equal to what was specified. i.e. col-sm-push-5 will only push 5 columns on sm view-ports or greater. This is because Bootstrap is a ""mobile first"" framework, so your HTML should reflect the mobile version of your site. The Pushing and Pulling are then done on the larger screens.

(Desktop) Larger view-ports get pushed and pulled.
(Mobile) Smaller view-ports render in normal order.

<div class=""row"">
    <div class=""col-sm-5 col-sm-push-5"">
        Content B

So mine is something like this:
[5] [5] [2]

And what I want to achieve is, when it's viewed on Desktop the layout above is displayed, but when it's viewed on mobile, I want to show the second length 5 object first, then the first length 5 object, and finally the length 2 object, vertically. Like this:
[5] (second)
[5] (first)
[2]  

While I tried to follow the step explained in the above documentation, I got the first length 5 object over the second one despite being on mobile platforms, which as I said should display second length 5 object on the top. In other words, I got this:
[5] (first)
[5] (second)
[2] 

So how can I correctly put the second one over the first? Or since I use the same length object, could the column ordering not work?

22074985,632337.0,2014-02-27 16:50:16+00:00,22073740,56,"First of all DataGridTextColumn or any other supported dataGrid columns doesn't lie in Visual tree of DataGrid. Hence, by default it doesn't inherit DataContext of DataGrid. But, it works for Binding DP only and for not other DP's on DataGridColumn.
Since, they doesn't lie in same VisualTree so any try to get DataContext using RelativeSource won't work as well because DataGrid won't able to traverse up to DataGrid.
There are two ways to achieve that though:

First using Freezable class - Freezable objects can inherit the DataContext even when theyâre not in the visual or logical tree. So, we can take advantage of that to our use.
First create class inheriting from Freezable and Data DP which we can use to bind in XAML:
public class BindingProxy : Freezable
{
    #region Overrides of Freezable

    protected override Freezable CreateInstanceCore()
    {
        return new BindingProxy();
    }

    #endregion

    public object Data
    {
        get { return (object)GetValue(DataProperty); }
        set { SetValue(DataProperty, value); }
    }

    public static readonly DependencyProperty DataProperty =
        DependencyProperty.Register(""Data"", typeof(object),
                                     typeof(BindingProxy));
}

Now, add an instance of it in DataGrid resources so that it can inherit DataGrid's DataContext and then can bind with its Data DP:
    <DataGrid>
        <DataGrid.Resources>
            <local:BindingProxy x:Key=""proxy"" Data=""{Binding}""/>
        </DataGrid.Resources>
        <DataGrid.Columns>
            <DataGridTextColumn Visibility=""{Binding Data.MyColumnVisibility,
                                                Source={StaticResource proxy}}""/>
        </DataGrid.Columns>
    </DataGrid>


Second, you can refer to any UI element in XAML using ElementName or x:Reference. But ElementName works only in same visual tree whereas x:Reference doesn't have such constraint.
So, we can use that as well to our advantage. Create dummy FrameworkElement in XAML with Visibility set to collapsed. FrameworkElement will inherit DataContext from it's parent container which can be Window or UserControl.
And can use that in DataGrid:
    <FrameworkElement x:Name=""dummyElement"" Visibility=""Collapsed""/>
    <DataGrid>
        <DataGrid.Columns>
            <DataGridTextColumn Header=""Test""
                                Binding=""{Binding Name}""
                                Visibility=""{Binding DataContext.IsEnable,
                                          Source={x:Reference dummyElement}}""/>

The general syntax is:
array.map(func)

func should take one parameter.
The return value of array.map is another array, so you can use it like this:
var x = [1,2,3,4].map( function(item) { return item * 10; } );

And now x is [10,20,30,40].
I must clarify: This concept is from the functional paradigm.
You don't have to write the function inline; one might do so as a first sketch, but you could then extract it into its own function.
var item_processor = function(item) {
      // do something complicated to an item
}

new_list = my_list.map(item_processor);

which would be sort-of equivalent to:
 for(item in my_list) { item_processor(item); }

except you don't get the new_list.

6. String fromCharArray = new String(new char[]{x});


Note: Character.toString(char) returns String.valueOf(char). So effectively both are same.

String.valueOf(char[] value) invokes new String(char[] value), which in turn sets the value char array.
public String(char value[]) {
    this.value = Arrays.copyOf(value, value.length);
}

On the other hand String.valueOf(char value) invokes the following package private constructor.
String(char[] value, boolean share) {
    // assert share : ""unshared not supported"";
    this.value = value;
}

Source code from String.java in Java 8 source code

Hence String.valueOf(char) seems to be most efficient method, in terms of both memory and speed, for converting char to String.

A Map that further provides a total ordering on its keys. 

However, using an external collection, you can always sort Map.entrySet() however you wish, either by keys, values, or even a combination(!!) of the two.
Here's a generic method that returns a SortedSet of Map.Entry, given a Map whose values are Comparable:
static <K,V extends Comparable<? super V>>
SortedSet<Map.Entry<K,V>> entriesSortedByValues(Map<K,V> map) {
    SortedSet<Map.Entry<K,V>> sortedEntries = new TreeSet<Map.Entry<K,V>>(
        new Comparator<Map.Entry<K,V>>() {
            @Override public int compare(Map.Entry<K,V> e1, Map.Entry<K,V> e2) {
                int res = e1.getValue().compareTo(e2.getValue());
                return res != 0 ? res : 1;
            }
        }
    );
    sortedEntries.addAll(map.entrySet());
    return sortedEntries;
}

Now you can do the following:
    Map<String,Integer> map = new TreeMap<String,Integer>();
    map.put(""A"", 3);
    map.put(""B"", 2);
    map.put(""C"", 1);   

    System.out.println(map);
    // prints ""{A=3, B=2, C=1}""
    System.out.println(entriesSortedByValues(map));
    // prints ""[C=1, B=2, A=3]""

Note that funky stuff will happen if you try to modify either the SortedSet itself, or the Map.Entry within, because this is no longer a ""view"" of the original map like entrySet() is.
Generally speaking, the need to sort a map's entries by its values is atypical.

Note on == for Integer
Your original comparator compares Integer using ==. This is almost always wrong, since == with Integer operands is a reference equality, not value equality.
    System.out.println(new Integer(0) == new Integer(0)); // prints ""false""!!!

2145605,8206.0,2010-01-27 09:11:10+00:00,2145590,813,"By default, Makefile targets are ""file targets"" - they are used to build files from other files. Make assumes its target is a file, and this makes writing Makefiles relatively easy:
foo: bar
  create_one_from_the_other foo bar

However, sometimes you want your Makefile to run commands that do not represent physical files in the file system. Good examples for this are the common targets ""clean"" and ""all"". Chances are this isn't the case, but you may potentially have a file named clean in your main directory. In such a case Make will be confused because by default the clean target would be associated with this file and Make will only run it when the file doesn't appear to be up-to-date with regards to its dependencies.
These special targets are called phony and you can explicitly tell Make they're not associated with files, e.g.:
.PHONY: clean
clean:
  rm -rf *.o

Now make clean will run as expected even if you do have a file named clean.
In terms of Make, a phony target is simply a target that is always out-of-date, so whenever you ask make <phony_target>, it will run, independent from the state of the file system. Some common make targets that are often phony are: all, install, clean, distclean, TAGS, info, check.
For more information, there's a nice tutorial explaining it here.

This is a frequently asked question, and one which was solved (and optimized) long ago. Jeffrey Friedl covers this question in depth (as an example) in his classic work: Mastering Regular Expressions (3rd Edition). Here is the regex you are looking for:
Good:

Version 1: Works correctly but is not terribly efficient.
Better:
""([^""\\]++|\\.)*"" or ""((?>[^""\\]+)|\\.)*""
Version 2: More efficient if you have possessive quantifiers or atomic groups (See: sin's correct answer which uses the atomic group method).
Best:
""[^""\\]*(?:\\.[^""\\]*)*""
Version 3: More efficient still. Implements Friedl's: ""unrolling-the-loop"" technique. Does not require possessive or atomic groups (i.e. this can be used in Javascript and other less-featured regex engines.)
Here are the recommended regexes in PHP syntax for both double and single quoted sub-strings:

What is the difference between new self and new static?

self refers to the same class in which the new keyword is actually written.
static, in PHP 5.3's late static bindings, refers to whatever class in the hierarchy you called the method on.
In the following example, B inherits both methods from A. The self invocation is bound to A because it's defined in A's implementation of the first method, whereas static is bound to the called class (also see get_called_class()).
class A {
    public static function get_self() {
        return new self();
    }

    public static function get_static() {

Don't use the terms ""strong"" and ""weak"" typing, because they don't have a universally agreed on technical meaning.  By contrast, static typing means that programs are checked before being executed, and a program might be rejected before it starts.  Dynamic typing means that the types of values are checked during execution, and a poorly typed operation might cause the program to halt or otherwise signal an error at run time.  A primary reason for static typing is to rule out programs that might have such ""dynamic type errors"".  
Strong typing generally means that there are no loopholes in the type system, whereas weak typing means the type system can be subverted (invalidating any guarantees).  The terms are often used incorrectly to mean static and dynamic typing.
To see the difference, think of C: the language is type-checked at compile time (static typing), but there are plenty of loopholes; you can pretty much cast a value of any type to another type of the same size---in particular, you can cast pointer types freely.  Pascal was a language that was intended to be strongly typed but famously had an unforeseen loophole: a variant record with no tag.
Implementations of strongly typed languages often acquire loopholes over time, usually so that part of the run-time system can be implemented in the high-level language.  For example, Objective Caml has a function called Obj.magic which has the run-time effect of simply returning its argument, but at compile time it converts a value of any type to one of any other type.  My favorite example is Modula-3, whose designers called their type-casting construct LOOPHOLE.
Having said that, you can't count on any two people using the words ""strong"" and ""weak"" in exactly the same way.  So avoid them.

What would be nice is if someone could please spell this out clearly here for me and the rest of the world.

1653415,14860.0,2009-10-31 04:31:25+00:00,1653340,229,"The use of fork and exec exemplifies the spirit of UNIX in that it provides a very simple way to start new processes.
The fork call basically makes a duplicate of the current process, identical in almost every way (not everything is copied over, for example, resource limits in some implementations but the idea is to create as close a copy as possible).
The new process (child) gets a different process ID (PID) and has the the PID of the old process (parent) as its parent PID (PPID). Because the two processes are now running exactly the same code, they can tell which is which by the return code of fork - the child gets 0, the parent gets the PID of the child. This is all, of course, assuming the fork call works - if not, no child is created and the parent gets an error code.
The exec call is a way to basically replace the entire current process with a new program. It loads the program into the current process space and runs it from the entry point.
So, fork and exec are often used in sequence to get a new program running as a child of a current process. Shells typically do this whenever you try to run a program like find - the shell forks, then the child loads the find program into memory, setting up all command line arguments, standard I/O and so forth.
But they're not required to be used together. It's perfectly acceptable for a program to fork itself without execing if, for example, the program contains both parent and child code (you need to be careful what you do, each implementation may have restrictions). This was used quite a lot (and still is) for daemons which simply listen on a TCP port and fork a copy of themselves to process a specific request while the parent goes back to listening.
Similarly, programs that know they're finished and just want to run another program don't need to fork, exec and then wait for the child. They can just load the child directly into their process space.
Some UNIX implementations have an optimized fork which uses what they call copy-on-write. This is a trick to delay the copying of the process space in fork until the program attempts to change something in that space. This is useful for those programs using only fork and not exec in that they don't have to copy an entire process space.
If the exec is called following fork (and this is what happens mostly), that causes a write to the process space and it is then copied for the child process.
Note that there is a whole family of exec calls (execl, execle, execve and so on) but exec in context here means any of them.
The following diagram illustrates the typical fork/exec operation where the bash shell is used to list a directory with the ls command:
+--------+
| pid=7  |
| ppid=4 |
| bash   |
+--------+
    |
    | calls fork

To match any of the strings 01, 02, 03, 04, 05, 06, 07, 08, 09, 10, 11, or 12, something like this works:
0[1-9]|1[0-2]

References

regular-expressions.info/Character Classes

Numeric Ranges (have many examples on matching strings interpreted as numeric ranges)



Explanation
A character class, by itself, attempts to match one and exactly one character from the input string. [01-12] actually defines [012], a character class that matches one character from the input against any of the 3 characters 0, 1, or 2.
The - range definition goes from 1 to 1, which includes just 1. On the other hand, something like [1-9] includes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.
Beginners often make the mistakes of defining things like [this|that]. This doesn't ""work"". This character definition defines [this|a], i.e. it matches one character from the input against any of 6 characters in t, h, i, s, | or a. More than likely (this|that) is what is intended.
References

regular-expressions.info/Brackets for Grouping and Alternation with the vertical bar


How ranges are defined
So it's obvious now that a pattern like between [24-48] hours doesn't ""work"". The character class in this case is equivalent to [248].
That is, - in a character class definition doesn't define numeric range in the pattern. Regex engines doesn't really ""understand"" numbers in the pattern, with the exception of finite repetition syntax (e.g. a{3,5} matches between 3 and 5 a).
Range definition instead uses ASCII/Unicode encoding of the characters to define ranges. The character 0 is encoded in ASCII as decimal 48; 9 is 57. Thus, the character definition [0-9] includes all character whose values are between decimal 48 and 57 in the encoding. Rather sensibly, by design these are the characters 0, 1, ..., 9.
See also

Wikipedia/ASCII


Another example: A to Z
Let's take a look at another common character class definition [a-zA-Z]
In ASCII:

A = 65, Z = 90
a = 97, z = 122

This means that:

[a-zA-Z] and [A-Za-z] are equivalent
In most flavors, [a-Z] is likely to be an illegal character range

because a (97) is ""greater than"" than Z (90)

[A-z] is legal, but also includes these six characters:

[ (91), \ (92), ] (93), ^ (94), _ (95), ` (96)

As angular is on the global scope itself and modules are saved to its variable you can access modules via angular.module('mymod'):
// one file
// NOTE: the immediately invoked function expression 
// is used to exemplify different files and is not required
(function(){
   // declaring the module in one file / anonymous function
   // (only pass a second parameter THIS ONE TIME as a redecleration creates bugs
   // which are very hard to dedect)
   angular.module('mymod', []);
})();


// another file and/or another anonymous function
(function(){   
 // using the function form of use-strict...
 ""use strict"";
  // accessing the module in another. 
  // this can be done by calling angular.module without the []-brackets
  angular.module('mymod')
    .controller('myctrl', ['dep1', function(dep1){
      //..
    }])

  // appending another service/controller/filter etc to the same module-call inside the same file
    .service('myservice', ['dep2', function(dep2){ 
    //... 
    }]);

  // you can of course use angular.module('mymod') here as well
  angular.module('mymod').controller('anothermyctrl', ['dep1', function(dep1){
      //..
  }])
})();

No other global variables are required.
Of course it depends all on preferences, but I think this is kind of the best practise, as 

you don't have to pollute the global scope
you can access your modules everywhere and sort them and their functions into different files at will
you can use the function-form of ""use strict"";
the loading order of files does not matter as much

Options for sorting your modules and files
This way of declaring and accessing modules makes you very flexible. You can sort modules via function-type (like described in another answer) or via route, e.g.:
/******** sorting by route **********/    
angular.module('home')...
angular.module('another-route')...
angular.module('shared')...

How you sort it in the end is a matter of personal taste and the scale and type of the project.  I personally like to group all files of a module inside of the same folder (ordered into sub-folders of directives, controllers, services and filters), including all different test-files, as it makes your modules more reusable. Thus in middle-sized projects I end up with a base-module, which includes all basic routes and their controllers, services, directives and more or less complex sub-modules, when I think they could be useful for other projects as well,e.g.:
/******** modularizing feature-sets **********/
/controllers
/directives
/filters
/services
/my-map-sub-module
/my-map-sub-module/controllers
/my-map-sub-module/services
app.js
...

angular.module('app', [
  'app.directives',
  'app.filters',
  'app.controllers',
  'app.services',
  'myMapSubModule'
]);

angular.module('myMapSubModule',[
   'myMapSubModule.controllers',
   'myMapSubModule.services',
   // only if they are specific to the module
   'myMapSubModule.directives',
   'myMapSubModule.filters'
]);

For very big projects, I sometimes end up grouping modules by routes, as described above or by some selected main routes or a even a combination of routes and some selected components, but it really depends.
EDIT:
Just because it is related and I ran into that very recently again: Take good care that you create a module only once (by adding a second parameter to the angular.module-function). This will mess up your application and can be very hard to detect.
2015 EDIT on sorting modules:
One and a half year of angular-experience later, I can add that the benefits from using differently named modules within your app are somewhat limited as AMD still does not really work well with Angular and services, directives and filters are globally available inside the angular context anyway (as exemplified here). There is still a semantic and structural benefit though and it might be helpful being able to include/ exclude a module with a single line of code commented in or out.
It also almost never makes much sense to separate sub-modules by type (eg. 'myMapSubModule.controllers') as they usually depend on each other. 
",19957280,1313904.0,2013-11-13 15:10:39+00:00,,97,AngularJS best practices for module declaration?,"I have a bunch of Angular modules declared in my app.  I originally started declaring them using the ""chained"" syntax like this:
angular.module('mymodule', [])
    .controller('myctrl', ['dep1', function(dep1){ ... }])
    .service('myservice', ['dep2', function(dep2){ ... }])
    ... // more here

But I decided that wasn't very easy to read, so I started declaring them using a module variable like this:
var mod = angular.module('mymodule', []);

mod.controller('myctrl', ['dep1', function(dep1){ ... }]);

mod.service('myservice', ['dep2', function(dep2){ ... }]);
...

The second syntax seems a lot more readable to me, but my only complaint is that this syntax leaves the mod variable out in the global scope.  If I ever have some other variable named mod, it would be overridden with this next one (and other issues associated with global variables).
So my question is, is this the best way?  Or would it be better to do something like this?:
(function(){
    var mod = angular.module('mymod', []);
    mod.controller('myctrl', ['dep1', function(dep1){ ... }]);
    mod.service('myservice', ['dep2', function(dep2){ ... }]);
    ...
})();

Or does it even matter enough to care?  Just curious to know what the ""best practices"" are for module declaration.  Thanks in advance.

You can use the System.Speech.Recognition namespace to do this...with some limitations.  Add System.Speech (should be in the GAC) to your project.  Here's some sample code for a WinForms app:
public partial class Form1 : Form
{
  SpeechRecognizer rec = new SpeechRecognizer();

  public Form1()
  {
    InitializeComponent();
    rec.SpeechRecognized += rec_SpeechRecognized;
  }

  void rec_SpeechRecognized(object sender, SpeechRecognizedEventArgs e)
  {
    lblLetter.Text = e.Result.Text;
  }

  void Form1_Load(object sender, EventArgs e)
  {
    var c = new Choices();
    for (var i = 0; i <= 100; i++)
      c.Add(i.ToString());
    var gb = new GrammarBuilder(c);
    var g = new Grammar(gb);
    rec.LoadGrammar(g);
    rec.Enabled = true;
  }

This recognizes the numbers from 1 to 100, and displays the resulting number on the form.  You'll need a form with a label called lblLetter on it.
System.Speech only works with a pre-defined list of words or phrases; it's not exactly NaturallySpeaking, either in versatility or in recognition quality.  But you don't have to train it to the user's voice, and if you only have a few different things the user can say, it works reasonably well.  And it's free!  (if you have Visual Studio)
It won't work well if you use very short phrases; I made a program for my kid to say letters of the alphabet and see them on-screen, but it doesn't do that well since many of the letters sound alike (especially from the mouth of a four-year-old).
As for more flexible options...well, there's the aforementioned NaturallySpeaking, which has an SDK.  But you have to contact sales to get any sort of access to it, and no pricing is listed, so it comes across as one of those ""How much does it cost?  Well, how much have you got?"" kind of things.  There doesn't seem to be a ""download and play around with it"" option.  :(
As for text-to-speech, System.Speech.Synthesis does this.  It's even easier than the speech recognition.  I wrote a small program to let me type, hit Enter, and read the text aloud.  My four-year-old gets mesmerized by it.  :)  (""Daddy, I wanna tawk to da wobot."")

I also need to be able to switch quickly between languages, without changing the language of the operating system.
The users will be using the system for very short periods.  The application needs to work without the requirement of first training the recognition engine to the users' voices.
It would also be fantastic if this could work on Windows XP or lesser versions of Windows Vista.
Optionally, the system needs to be able to read information on the screen back to the user, in the user's selected language.  I can work around this specification using pre-recorded voice-overs, but the preferred method would be to use a text-to-speech engine.

Enumerate all your local IP addresses (usually only 1).  Create a UDP socket on a given port number** for each adapter with an IP address.
For each socket created in step 1, contact a STUN or TURN server with that same socket to discover your external IP address and to discover what the internal port number maps to outside of the NAT (it's not always the same port value).  That is, your local address 192.168.1.2:4900 might be 128.11.12.13:8888 to the outside world.  And some NATs don't always use the same port mapping when using the same local port to other IP addresses.  TURN will also provide you a ""relay address"".  You can also use UPNP to get a port mapped address directly from your router, if it supports that protocol.
Through a rendezvous service (SIP, XMPP, instant message, web service, email, cups with strings), publish your address candidate list to a service or send a notification to the other client that says, ""hey, I want to connect with you"".  This message includes all the ""address candidates"" (ip and port pairs) collected in steps 1 and 2.
The remote client, upon receiving the invite to connect, performs step 1 and 2 above as well.  Then sends back his candidate list through the same channel that he received the inviter's candidate list on.
Hole punching step. Both clients, start sending test messages over UDP to the other side's address candidates and listening for the same messages on their end. Whenever a messages is received, reply back to the address from which it came. Eventually, the clients will discover that they have a pair of addresses that they can reliably send datagrams too. Typically, one endpoint makes the final decision on which address pair (sockets) to communicate with and the protocol facilitates this endpoint telling the other endpoint this decision.

**- usually best to not to rely on a well known port for P2P clients.  Because two clients behind the same NAT or firewall would not likely be able to use your software at the same time.
Here is a quick summary of some technologies to explore.
STUN - Is a simple server and protocol for clients behind a NAT/route to discover what their external IP and port mappings are.
TURN is an expansion to STUN, but supports relaying for P2P connectivity scenarios where firewalls and NATs prevent direct connections.
ICE is a set of steps by which STUN and TURN are used for setting up a P2P connection. ICE is a formal protocol for steps 1-5 above. Two excellent set of slides on ICE are here and here.
WebRTC is a variant of the ICE standard as well as a reference library for make P2P sessions with STUN and TURN.
UPNP + Internet Gateway Device Protocol - Some routers support this for hosts to automatically obtain port mappings.
libnice is an open source C library for Linux (and might work on windows) that implements ICE.
libjingle is another ICE implementation (in C++) from Google. For Windows and Linux.
PJNATH is a library within the PJSIP suite of coding libraries. It is a good implementation of an ICE stack (C code) and has been ported to a lot of platforms. (Windows, Linux, Mac, iOS, Symbian, and soon Android).

When an object is configured with a ""fixed"" Strategy, for example when the object is constructed, the distinction between Strategy and DI blurs. But in a DI scenario it is more unusual that the dependencies of objects change during their lifetimes, while this is not uncommon with Strategy.
Also, you can pass strategies as arguments to methods, while the related concept of method argument injection is not widespread and mostly used in the context of automated testing only.
Strategy focuses on intent and encourages you to create an interface with different implementations that obey the same behavioral contract. DI is more about just having an implementation of some behavior and providing it.
With DI you can decompose your program for other reasons than just to be able to swap parts of the implementation. An interface used in DI with only one implementation is very common. A ""Strategy"" with only one concrete implementation (ever) is not a real problem but is probably closer to DI.

One directory includes an implementation in C, contributed by IBM. Since October 2011, this is the code that actually runs when you call sin() on a typical x86-64 Linux system. It is apparently faster than the fsin assembly instruction. Source code: sysdeps/ieee754/dbl-64/s_sin.c, look for __sin (double x).
This code is very complex. No one software algorithm is as fast as possible and also accurate over the whole range of x values, so the library implements many different algorithms and its first job is to look at x and decide which algorithm to use. In some regions it uses what looks like the familiar Taylor series. Several of the algorithms first compute a quick result, then if that's not accurate enough, discard it and fall back on a slower algorithm.
Older 32-bit versions of GCC/glibc used the fsin instruction, which is surprisingly inaccurate for some inputs. There's a fascinating blog post illustrating this with just 2 lines of code.
fdlibm's implementation of sin in pure C is much simpler than glibc's and is nicely commented. Source code: fdlibm/s_sin.c and fdlibm/k_sin.c

Edit: I'm aware of several ways that functions can be calculated, and have written my own routines to compute functions using taylor series for fun.  I'm curious about how real, production languages do it, since all of my implementations are always several orders of magnitude slower, even though I think my algorithms are pretty clever (obviously they're not).

The word modal has been removed; As it has been for the presenting API call:

The reasons were discussed in the 2012 WWDC Session 236 - The Evolution of View Controllers on iOS Video. Essentially, view controllers presented by this API are no longer always modal, and since they were adding a completion handler it was a good time to rename it.
In response to comment from Marc:

What's the best way to support all devices 4.3 and above? The new
  method doesn't work in iOS4, yet the old method is deprecated in iOS6.

I realize that this is almost a separate question, but I think it's worth a mention since not everyone has the money to upgrade all their devices every 3 years so many of us have some older (pre 5.0) devices. Still, as much as it pains me to say it, you need to consider if it is worth targeting below 5.0. There are many new and cool APIs not available below 5.0. And Apple is continually making it harder to target them; armv6 support is dropped from Xcode 4.5, for example.
To target below 5.0 (as long as the completion block is nil) just use the handy respondsToSelector: method.
if ([self respondsToSelector:@selector(presentViewController:animated:completion:)]){
    [self presentViewController:test animated:YES completion:nil];
} else {
    [self presentModalViewController:test animated:YES];

In response to another comment from Marc:

That could be quite a lot of If statements in my application!...I was
  thinking of creating a category that encapsulated this code, would
  creating a category on UIViewControler get me rejected?

and one from Full Decent:

...is there a way to manually cause that to not present a compiler warning?

Firstly, no, creating a category on UIViewController in and of itself will not get your app rejected; unless that category method called private APIs or something similar.
A category method is an exceedingly good place for such code. Also, since there would be only one call to the deprecated API, there would be only one compiler warning.
To address Full Decent's comment(question), yes you can suppress compiler warnings manually. Here is a link to an answer on SO on that very subject. A category method is also a great place to suppress a compiler warning, since you're only suppressing the warning in one place. You certainly don't want to go around silencing the compiler willy-nilly. 
If I was to write a simple category method for this it might be something like this:
@implementation UIViewController (NJ_ModalPresentation)
-(void)nj_presentViewController:(UIViewController *)viewControllerToPresent animated:(BOOL)flag completion:(void (^)(void))completion{
    NSAssert(completion == nil, @""You called %@ with a non-nil completion. Don't do that!"",NSStringFromSelector(_cmd));

29525001,3841734.0,2015-04-08 20:44:16+00:00,29525000,90,"Concepts:
NALUs:  NALUs are simply a chunk of data of varying length that has a NALU start code header 0x00 00 00 01 YY where the first 5 bits of YY tells you what type of NALU this is and therefore what type of data follows the header.  (Since you only need the first 5 bits, I use YY & 0x1F to just get the relevant bits.)  I list what all these types are in the method NSString * const naluTypesStrings[], but you don't need to know what they all are.  
Parameters:  Your decoder needs parameters so it knows how the H.264 video data is stored.  The 2 you need to set are Sequence Parameter Set (SPS) and Picture Parameter Set (PPS) and they each have their own NALU type number.  You don't need to know what the parameters mean, the decoder knows what to do with them.
H.264 Stream Format:  In most H.264 streams, you will receive with an initial set of PPS and SPS parameters followed by an i frame (aka IDR frame or flush frame) NALU.  Then you will receive several P frame NALUs (maybe a few dozen or so), then another set of parameters (which may be the same as the initial parameters) and an i frame, more P frames, etc.  i frames are much bigger than P frames.  Conceptually you can think of the i frame as an entire image of the video, and the P frames are just the changes that have been made to that i frame, until you receive the next i frame.
Procedure:

Generate individual NALUs from your H.264 stream.  I cannot show code for this step since it depends a lot on what video source you're using.  I made this graphic to show what I was working with (""data"" in the graphic is ""frame"" in my following code), but your case may and probably will differ.  My method receivedRawVideoFrame: is called every time I receive a frame (uint8_t *frame) which was one of 2 types.  In the diagram, those 2 frame types are the 2 big purple boxes.
Create a CMVideoFormatDescriptionRef from your SPS and PPS NALUs with CMVideoFormatDescriptionCreateFromH264ParameterSets( ).  You cannot display any frames without doing this first.  The SPS and PPS may look like a jumble of numbers, but VTD knows what to do with them.  All you need to know is that CMVideoFormatDescriptionRef is a description of video data., like width/height, format type (kCMPixelFormat_32BGRA, kCMVideoCodecType_H264 etc.), aspect ratio, color space etc.  Your decoder will hold onto the parameters until a new set arrives (sometimes parameters are resent regularly even when they haven't changed).
Re-package your IDR and non-IDR frame NALUs according to the ""AVCC"" format.  This means removing the NALU start codes and replacing them with a 4-byte header that states the length of the NALU. You don't need to do this for the SPS and PPS NALUs.  (Note that the 4-byte NALU length header is in big-endian, so if you have a UInt32 value it must be byte-swapped before copying to the CMBlockBuffer using CFSwapInt32.  I do this in my code with the htonl function call.)
Package the IDR and non-IDR NALU frames into CMBlockBuffer. Do not do this with the SPS PPS parameter NALUs.  All you need to know about CMBlockBuffers is that they are a method to wrap arbitrary blocks of data in core media. (Any compressed video data in a video pipeline is wrapped in this.)
Package the CMBlockBuffer into CMSampleBuffer.  All you need to know about CMSampleBuffers is that they wrap up our CMBlockBuffers with other information (here it would be the CMVideoFormatDescription and CMTime, if CMTime is used).
Create a VTDecompressionSessionRef and feed the sample buffers into VTDecompressionSessionDecodeFrame( ). Alternatively, you can use AVSampleBufferDisplayLayer and its enqueueSampleBuffer: method and you won't need to use VTDecompSession.  It's simpler to set up, but will not throw errors if something goes wrong like VTD will.
In the VTDecompSession callback, use the resultant CVImageBufferRef to display the video frame.  If you need to convert your CVImageBuffer to a UIImage, see my StackOverflow answer here.

Other notes:

H.264 streams can vary a lot.  From what I learned, NALU start code headers are sometimes 3 bytes (0x00 00 01) and sometimes 4 (0x00 00 00 01).  My code works for 4 bytes; you will need to change a few things around if you're working with 3.
If you want to know more about NALUs, I found this answer to be very helpful.  In my case, I found that I didn't need to ignore the ""emulation prevention"" bytes as described, so I personally skipped that step but you may need to know about that.
If your VTDecompressionSession outputs an error number (like -12909) look up the error code in your XCode project.  Find the VideoToolbox framework in your project navigator, open it and find the header VTErrors.h.  If you can't find it, I've also included all the error codes below in another answer.

Code Example:
So let's start by declaring some global variables and including the VT framework (VT = Video Toolbox). 
#import <VideoToolbox/VideoToolbox.h>

@property (nonatomic, assign) CMVideoFormatDescriptionRef formatDesc;
@property (nonatomic, assign) VTDecompressionSessionRef decompressionSession;
@property (nonatomic, retain) AVSampleBufferDisplayLayer *videoLayer;
@property (nonatomic, assign) int spsSize;
@property (nonatomic, assign) int ppsSize;

The following array is only used so that you can print out what type of NALU frame you are receiving.  If you know what all these types mean, good for you, you know more about H.264 than me :)  My code only handles types 1, 5, 7 and 8.

Show it is in NP
In other words, given some information C, you can create a polynomial time algorithm V that will verify for every possible input X whether X is in your domain or not. 
Example
Prove that the problem of vertex covers (that is, for some graph G, does it have a vertex cover set of size k such that every edge in G has at least one vertex in the cover set?) is in NP:

our input X is some graph G and some number k (this is from the problem definition)
Take our information C to be ""any possible subset of vertices in graph G of size k""
Then we can write an algorithm V that, given G, k and C, will return whether that set of vertices is a vertex cover for G or not, in polynomial time.

Then for every graph G, if there exists some ""possible subset of vertices in G of size k"" which is a vertex cover, then G is in NP.
Note that we do not need to find C in polynomial time. If we could, the problem would be in `P.
Note that algorithm V should work for every G, for some C. For every input there should exist information that could help us verify whether the input is in the problem domain or not. That is, there should not be an input where the information doesn't exist.
Prove it is NP Hard
This involves getting a known NP-complete problem like SAT, the set of boolean expressions in the form:

(A or B or C) and (D or E or F) and ...

where the expression is satisfiable, that is there exists some setting for these booleans, which makes the expression true.
Then reduce the NP-complete problem to your problem in polynomial time.
That is, given some input X for SAT (or whatever NP-complete problem you are using), create some input Y for your problem, such that X is in SAT if and only if Y is in your problem. The function f : X -> Y must run in polynomial time.
In the example above, the input Y would be the graph G and the size of the vertex cover k.
For a full proof, you'd have to prove both:

that X is in SAT => Y in your problem
and Y in your problem => X in SAT.

marcog's answer has a link with several other NP-complete problems you could reduce to your problem.

73021,12541.0,2008-09-16 14:37:00+00:00,40480,1922,"I just noticed you referenced my article.
The Java Spec says that everything in Java is pass-by-value. There is no such thing as ""pass-by-reference"" in Java.
The key to understanding this is that something like
Dog myDog;

is not a Dog; it's actually a pointer to a Dog.
What that means, is when you have
Dog myDog = new Dog(""Rover"");
foo(myDog);

you're essentially passing the address of the created Dog object to the foo method.
(I say essentially because Java pointers aren't direct addresses, but it's easiest to think of them that way)
Suppose the Dog object resides at memory address 42. This means we pass 42 to the method.
if the Method were defined as
public void foo(Dog someDog) {
    someDog.setName(""Max"");     // AAA
    someDog = new Dog(""Fifi"");  // BBB
    someDog.setName(""Rowlf"");   // CCC
}

let's look at what's happening.

the parameter someDog is set to the value 42
at line ""AAA""


someDog is followed to the Dog it points to (the Dog object at address 42)
that Dog (the one at address 42) is asked to change his name to Max

at line ""BBB""


a new Dog is created. Let's say he's at address 74
we assign the parameter someDog to 74 

at line ""CCC""


someDog is followed to the Dog it points to (the Dog object at address 74)
that Dog (the one at address 74) is asked to change his name to Rowlf

then, we return

Now let's think about what happens outside the method:
Did myDog change?
There's the key.
Keeping in mind that myDog is a pointer, and not an actual Dog, the answer is NO. myDog still has the value 42; it's still pointing to the original Dog (but note that because of line ""AAA"", its name is now ""Max"" - still the same Dog; myDog's value has not changed.)
It's perfectly valid to follow an address and change what's at the end of it; that does not change the variable, however.
Java works exactly like C. You can assign a pointer, pass the pointer to a method, follow the pointer in the method and change the data that was pointed to. However, you cannot change where that pointer points.
In C++, Ada, Pascal and other languages that support pass-by-reference, you can actually change the variable that was passed.
If Java had pass-by-reference semantics, the foo method we defined above would have changed where myDog was pointing when it assigned someDog on line BBB.
Think of reference parameters as being aliases for the variable passed in. When that alias is assigned, so is the variable that was passed in.

10069679,291827.0,2012-04-09 06:20:48+00:00,9942560,147,"Before I get to your question, here's a brief explanation of the two storage types:
Cache
This is an app-specific directory on the filesystem. The intent for this directory is store temporary data your application may need to keep around between sessions, but may not be vital to keep them forever. You typically access this directory with Context.getCacheDir(). This will show up as ""Cache"" on your app settings.
Files
Like the cache directory, your app also has an app-specific directory for holding files. Files in this directory will exist until the app explicitly deletes them or the app is uninstalled. You typically access this directory with Context.getFilesDir(). This can show up as various things on the app info screen, but in your screenshot this is ""USB Storage Data"". 
NOTE: If you want to explicitly place on external media (typically SD card), you can use Context.getExternalFilesDir(String type).
The Difference
Both directories are specific only to your application (other apps do not have access). One of the differences between the cache and files directory is that if the system gets low on storage, the first place it is going to free resources is from your cache directory. The system will not clear any data from the files directory. Another difference is that the cache directory can typically be cleared manually from the app info screen. The files directory typically can as well, but clearing the files directory will also clear the cache directory.
Which one do I use?
It depends on how vital that data is compared to the lifetime of your app. If you only need data for one session and you doubt you'll ever need to use that data again, then don't use either. Just keep it in memory until you don't need it. If you suspect you'll need to reuse the data between multiple sessions, but you don't have to keep a hard copy, use the cache directory. If you must have this data no matter what, or if it's rather large data that needs persistent storage, use the files directory. Here's some examples I can think of:

Cache - A recently opened email

Once opened, cache the data so when the user wants to read that email again, it loads instantly rather using the network again to retrieve the same data. I don't need to keep this forever, because eventually the user will be finished with the email.

Files - An attachment downloaded from an email

This is an action by the user who is saying ""I want to keep this data so I can pull it back up whenever I need it."" Therefore, put it in files directory as I don't ever want to delete this file until the user wants it deleted.


When should I clear the cache directory?
From the Context.getCacheDir() javadocs:

Note: you should not rely on the system deleting these files for you;
  you should always have a reasonable maximum, such as 1 MB, for the
  amount of space you consume with cache files, and prune those files
  when exceeding that space.

It uses the example of 1 MB, but that may or may not be reasonable for your app. Regardless, you need to set a hard maximum. The reason for this simply comes down to designing a responsible app. So when should you check? I would recommend checking every time you want to put something in the cache directory. Here's a very simple cache manager:
public class CacheManager {

    private static final long MAX_SIZE = 5242880L; // 5MB

    private CacheManager() {

    }

    public static void cacheData(Context context, byte[] data, String name) throws IOException {

        File cacheDir = context.getCacheDir();
        long size = getDirSize(cacheDir);
        long newSize = data.length + size;

        if (newSize > MAX_SIZE) {
            cleanDir(cacheDir, newSize - MAX_SIZE);
        }

        File file = new File(cacheDir, name);
        FileOutputStream os = new FileOutputStream(file);
        try {
            os.write(data);
        }
        finally {
            os.flush();
            os.close();
        }
    }

    public static byte[] retrieveData(Context context, String name) throws IOException {

        File cacheDir = context.getCacheDir();
        File file = new File(cacheDir, name);

        if (!file.exists()) {
            // Data doesn't exist
            return null;
        }

        byte[] data = new byte[(int) file.length()];
        FileInputStream is = new FileInputStream(file);
        try {
            is.read(data);
        }
        finally {
            is.close();
        }

        return data;
    }

    private static void cleanDir(File dir, long bytes) {

        long bytesDeleted = 0;
        File[] files = dir.listFiles();

        for (File file : files) {
            bytesDeleted += file.length();
            file.delete();

            if (bytesDeleted >= bytes) {
                break;
            }
        }
    }

    private static long getDirSize(File dir) {

        long size = 0;
        File[] files = dir.listFiles();

        for (File file : files) {
            if (file.isFile()) {
                size += file.length();
            }
        }

        return size;
    }
}

Of course, this could be an expensive operation, so you should plan on caching on a background thread.
Also, this could be as complicated as you need it to be. In my example, I'm assuming all cached files are placed at the root of the cache directory, so I don't check for potential sub-directories. The routine for deleting files can also become more sophisticated, such as deleting files by oldest access date.
One thing to keep in mind when deciding to cache data is that you need to always plan for the case that your cached data no longer exists. Always have a routine in place to retrieve data by external means when your cache doesn't have it in storage. Likewise, always check your cache before retrieve data externally. The purpose of the cache is to cut down on network activity, long processes, and provide a responsive UI in your app. So use it responsibly :)

You should always maintain the cache files yourself and stay within a
  reasonable limit of space consumed, such as 1MB. When the user
  uninstalls your application, these files are removed.

So I took a look at the Currents app (Galaxy Nexus) and the cache size for the application is 110 MB. But what's weird is that applications like Google Currents & Google Maps cache the content in something called (USB Storage Data) :

So what is this 'USB Storage Data' that the previous application uses. And if you implement caching in your application, Do you loop over all your application files in cache to get the size every time you need to insert something and then compare and clear it? Or do you keep caching the content until Android decides its time to clean some application cache directory ?
I'm really interested to know what is the flow of managing cache in Android, or at least what other applications do with large content to cache.

16 / 2 = 8
 8 / 2 = 4
 4 / 2 = 2
 2 / 2 = 1

Notice that this ends up taking four steps to complete.  Interestingly, we also have that log2 16 = 4.  Hmmm...  what about 128?
128 / 2 = 64
 64 / 2 = 32
 32 / 2 = 16
 16 / 2 = 8
  8 / 2 = 4
  4 / 2 = 2
  2 / 2 = 1

This took seven steps, and log2 128 = 7.  Is this a coincidence?  Nope!  There's a good reason for this.  Suppose that we divide a number n by 2 i times.  Then we get the number n / 2i.  If we want to solve for the value of i where this value is at most 1, we get

n / 2i ≤ 1
n ≤ 2i
log2 n ≤ i

In other words, if we pick an integer i such that i ≥ log2 n, then after diving n by 2 i times we'll have a value that is at most 1.  The smallest i for which this is guaranteed is roughly log2 n, so if we have an algorithm that divides by 2 until the number gets sufficiently small, then we can say that it terminates in O(log n) steps.
An important detail is that it doesn't matter what constant you're dividing n by (as long as it's greater than one); if you divide by the constant k, it will take logk n steps to reach 1.  Thus any algorithm that repeatedly divides the input size by some fraction will need O(log n) iterations to terminate.  Those iterations might take a lot of time and so the net runtime needn't be O(log n), but the number of steps will be logarithmic.
So where does this come up?  One classic example is binary search, a fast algorithm for searching a sorted array for a value.  The algorithm works like this:

If the array is empty, return that the element isn't present in the array.
Otherwise:


Look at the middle element of the array.
If it's equal to the element we're looking for, return success.
If it's greater than the element we're looking for:


Throw away the second half of the array.
Repeat

If it's less than the the element we're looking for:


Throw away the first half of the array.
Repeat



For example, to search for 5 in the array
1   3   5   7   9   11   13

We'd first look at the middle element:
1   3   5   7   9   11   13
            ^

Since 7 > 5, and since the array is sorted, we know for a fact that the number 5 can't be in the back half of the array, so we can just discard it.  This leaves
1   3   5

So now we look at the middle element here:
1   3   5
    ^

Since 3 < 5, we know that 5 can't appear in the first half of the array, so we can throw the first half array to leave
        5

Again we look at the middle of this array:
        5
        ^

Since this is exactly the number we're looking for, we can report that 5 is indeed in the array.
So how efficient is this?  Well, on each iteration we're throwing away at least half of the remaining array elements.  The algorithm stops as soon as the array is empty or we find the value we want.  In the worst case, the element isn't there, so we keep halving the size of the array until we run out of elements.  How long does this take?  Well, since we keep cutting the array in half over and over again, we will be done in at most O(log n) iterations, since we can't cut the array in half more than O(log n) times before we run out of array elements.
Algorithms following the general technique of divide-and-conquer (cutting the problem into pieces, solving those pieces, then putting the problem back together) tend to have logarithmic terms in them for this same reason - you can't keep cutting some object in half more than O(log n) times.  You might want to look at merge sort as a great example of this.
Processing values one digit at a time
How many digits are in the base-10 number n?  Well, if there are k digits in the number, then we'd have that the biggest digit is some multiple of 10k.  The largest k-digit number is 999...9, k times, and this is equal to 10k + 1 - 1.  Consequently, if we know that n has k digits in it, then we know that the value of n is at most 10k + 1 - 1.  If we want to solve for k in terms of n, we get

n ≤ 10k+1 - 1
n + 1 ≤ 10k+1
log10 (n + 1) ≤ k + 1
(log10 (n + 1)) - 1 ≤ k

From which we get that k is approximately the base-10 logarithm of n.  In other words, the number of digits in n is O(log n).
For example, let's think about the complexity of adding two large numbers that are too big to fit into a machine word.  Suppose that we have those numbers represented in base 10, and we'll call the numbers m and n.  One way to add them is through the grade-school method - write the numbers out one digit at a time, then work from the right to the left.  For example, to add 1337 and 2065, we'd start by writing the numbers out as
    1  3  3  7
+   2  0  6  5
==============

We add the last digit and carry the 1:
          1
    1  3  3  7
+   2  0  6  5
==============
             2

Then we add the second-to-last (""penultimate"") digit and carry the 1:
       1  1
    1  3  3  7
+   2  0  6  5
==============
          0  2

Next, we add the third-to-last (""antepenultimate"") digit:
       1  1
    1  3  3  7
+   2  0  6  5
==============
       4  0  2

Finally, we add the fourth-to-last (""preantepenultimate""... I love English) digit:
       1  1
    1  3  3  7
+   2  0  6  5
==============
    3  4  0  2

Now, how much work did we do?  We do a total of O(1) work per digit (that is, a constant amount of work), and there are O(max{log n, log m}) total digits that need to be processed.  This gives a total of O(max{log n, log m}) complexity, because we need to visit each digit in the two numbers.
Many algorithms get an O(log n) term in them from working one digit at a time in some base.  A classic example is radix sort, which sorts integers one digit at a time.  There are many flavors of radix sort, but they usually run in time O(n log U), where U is the largest possible integer that's being sorted.  The reason for this is that each pass of the sort takes O(n) time, and there are a total of O(log U) iterations required to process each of the O(log U) digits of the largest number being sorted.  Many advanced algorithms, such as Gabow's shortest-paths algorithm or the scaling version of the Ford-Fulkerson max-flow algorithm, have a log term in their complexity because they work one digit at a time.

As to your second question about how you solve that problem, you may want to look at this related question which explores a more advanced application.  Given the general structure of problems that are described here, you now can have a better sense of how to think about problems when you know there's a log term in the result, so I would advise against looking at the answer until you've given it some thought.
Hope this helps!

So the first question is this: What do you need?
I Need Full XML Compliance
OK, so you need to process XML. Not toy XML, real XML. You need to be able to read and write all of the XML specification, not just the low-lying, easy-to-parse bits. You need Namespaces, DocTypes, entity substitution, the works. The W3C XML Specification, in its entirety.
The next question is: Does your API need to conform to DOM or SAX?
I Need Exact DOM and/or SAX Conformance
OK, so you really need the API to be DOM and/or SAX. It can't just be a SAX-style push parser, or a DOM-style retained parser. It must be the actual DOM or the actual SAX, to the extent that C++ allows.
You have chosen:
Xerces
That's your choice. It's pretty much the only C++ XML parser/writer that has full (or as near as C++ allows) DOM and SAX conformance. It also has XInclude support, XML Schema support, and a plethora of other features.
It has no real dependencies. It uses the Apache license.
I Don't Care About DOM and/or SAX Conformance
You have chosen:
LibXML2
LibXML2 offers a C-style interface (if that really bothers you, go use Xerces), though the interface is at least somewhat object-based and easily wrapped. It provides a lot of features, like XInclude support (with callbacks so that you can tell it where it gets the file from), an XPath 1.0 recognizer, RelaxNG and Schematron support (though the error messages leave a lot to be desired), and so forth.
It does have a dependency on iconv, but it can be configured without that dependency. Though that does mean that you'll have a more limited set of possible text encodings it can parse.
It uses the MIT license.
I Do Not Need Full XML Compliance
OK, so full XML compliance doesn't matter to you. Your XML documents are either fully under your control or are guaranteed to use the ""basic subset"" of XML: no namespaces, entities, etc.
So what does matter to you? The next question is: What is the most important thing to you in your XML work?
Maximum XML Parsing Performance
Your application needs to take XML and turn it into C++ datastructures as fast as this conversion can possibly happen. 
You have chosen:
RapidXML
This XML parser is exactly what it says on the tin: rapid XML. It doesn't even deal with pulling the file into memory; how that happens is up to you. What it does deal with is parsing that into a series of C++ data structures that you can access. And it does this about as fast as it takes to scan the file byte by byte.
Of course, there's no such thing as a free lunch. Like most XML parsers that don't care about the XML specification, Rapid XML doesn't touch namespaces, DocTypes, entities (with the exception of character entities and the 6 basic XML ones), and so forth. So basically nodes, elements, attributes, and such.
Also, it is a DOM-style parser. So it does require that you read all of the text in. However, what it doesn't do is copy any of that text (usually). The way RapidXML gets most of its speed is by refering to strings in-place. This requires more memory management on your part (you must keep that string alive while RapidXML is looking at it).
RapidXML's DOM is bare-bones. You can get string values for things. You can search for attributes by name. That's about it. There are no convenience functions to turn attributes into other values (numbers, dates, etc). You just get strings.
One other downside with RapidXML is that it is painful for writing XML. It requires you to do a lot of explicit memory allocation of string names in order to build its DOM. It does provide a kind of string buffer, but that still requires a lot of explicit work on your end. It's certainly functional, but it's a pain to use.
It uses the MIT licence. It is a header-only library with no dependencies.

There is a RapidXML ""GitHub patch"" that allows it to also work with namespaces.

I Care About Performance But Not Quite That Much
Yes, performance matters to you. But maybe you need something a bit less bare-bones. Maybe something that can handle more Unicode, or doesn't require so much user-controlled memory management. Performance is still important, but you want something a little less direct.
You have chosen:
PugiXML
Historically, this served as inspiration for RapidXML. But the two projects have diverged, with Pugi offering more features, while RapidXML is focused entirely on speed.
PugiXML offers Unicode conversion support, so if you have some UTF-16 docs around and want to read them as UTF-8, Pugi will provide. It even has an XPath 1.0 implementation, if you need that sort of thing.
But Pugi is still quite fast. Like RapidXML, it has no dependencies and is distributed under the MIT License.
Reading Huge Documents
You need to read documents that are measured in the gigabytes in size. Maybe you're getting them from stdin, being fed by some other process. Or you're reading them from massive files. Or whatever. The point is, what you need is to not have to read the entire file into memory all at once in order to process it.
You have chosen:
LibXML2
Xerces's SAX-style API will work in this capacity, but LibXML2 is here because it's a bit easier to work with. A SAX-style API is a push-API: it starts parsing a stream and just fires off events that you have to catch. You are forced to manage context, state, and so forth. Code that reads a SAX-style API is a lot more spread out than one might hope.
LibXML2's xmlReader object is a pull-API. You ask to go to the next XML node or element; you aren't told. This allows you to store context as you see fit, to handle different entities in a way that's much more readable in code than a bunch of callbacks.
Alternatives
Expat
Expat is a well-known C++ parser that uses a pull-parser API. It was written by James Clark.
It's current status is... not active. The most recent version is 2.1.0, which was released 3 years ago. That doesn't mean it can't be useful. But it does mean that, if there are bugs in it, you will have to fix them.
You can still use it. Just be aware of what you're getting.
LlamaXML
It is an implementation of an StAX-style API. It is a pull-parser, similar to LibXML2's xmlReader parser.
But it hasn't been updated since 2005. So again, Caveat Emptor.
XPath Support
XPath is a system for querying elements within an XML tree. It's a handy way of effectively naming an element or collection of element by common properties, using a standardized syntax. Many XML libraries offer XPath support.
There are effectively three choices here:

LibXML2: It provides full XPath 1.0 support. Again, it is a C API, so if that bothers you, there are alternatives.
PugiXML: It comes with XPath 1.0 support as well. As above, it's more of a C++ API than LibXML2, so you may be more comfortable with it.
TinyXML: It does not come with XPath support, but there is the TinyXPath library that provides it. TinyXML is undergoing a conversion to version 2.0, which significantly changes the API, so TinyXPath may not work with the new API. Like TinyXML itself, TinyXPath is distributed under the zLib license.

Just Get The Job Done
So, you don't care about XML correctness. Performance isn't an issue for you. Streaming is irrelevant. All you want is something that gets XML into memory and allows you to stick it back onto disk again. What you care about is API.
You want an XML parser that's going to be small, easy to install, trivial to use, and small enough to be irrelevant to your eventual executable's size.
You have chosen:
TinyXML
I put TinyXML in this slot because it is about as braindead simple to use as XML parsers get. Yes, it's slow, but it's simple and obvious. It has a lot of convenience functions for converting attributes and so forth.
Writing XML is no problem in TinyXML. You just new up some objects, attach them together, send the document to a std::ostream, and everyone's happy.
There is also something of an ecosystem built around TinyXML, with a more iterator-friendly API, and even an XPath 1.0 implementation layered on top of it.
TinyXML uses the zLib license, which is more or less the MIT License with a different name.

4897267,3424.0,2011-02-04 11:02:36+00:00,4893720,111,"Disclosure: I am the author of Faye.

Regarding Faye, everything you've said is true.
Faye implements most of Bayeux, the only thing missing right now is service channels, which I've yet to be convinced of the usefulness of. In particular Faye is designed to be compatible with the CometD reference implementation of Bayeux, which has a large bearing on the following.
Conceptually, yes: Faye could use Socket.IO. In practise, there are some barriers to this:

I've no idea what kind of server-side support Socket.IO requires, and the requirement that the Faye client (there are server-side clients in Node and Ruby, remember) be able to talk to any Bayeux server (and the Faye server to any Bayeux client) may be deal-breaker.
Bayeux has specific requirements that servers and clients support certain transport types, and says how to negotiate which one to use. It also specifies how they are used, for example how the Content-Type of an XHR request affects how its content is interpreted.
For some types of error handling I need direct access to the transport, for example resending messages when a client reconnects after a Node WebSocket dies.
Please correct me if I've got any of this wrong - this is based on a cursory scan of the Socket.IO documentation.

Faye is just pub/sub, it's just based on a slightly more complex protocol and has a lot of niceties built in:

Server- and client-side extensions
Wildcard pattern-matching on channel routes
Automatic reconnection, e.g. when WebSockets die or the server goes offline
The client works in all browsers, on phones, and server-side on Node and Ruby


Faye probably looks a lot more complex compared to Juggernaut because Juggernaut delegates more, e.g. it delegates transport negotiation to Socket.IO and message routing to Redis. These are both fine decisions, but my decision to use Bayeux means I have to do more work myself.
As for design philosophy, Faye's overriding goal is that it should work everywhere the Web is available and should be absolutely trivial to get going with. I'ts really simple to get started with but its extensibility means it can be customized in quite powerful ways, for example you can turn it into a server-to-client push service (i.e. stop arbitrary clients pushing to it) by adding authentication extensions.
There is also work underway to make it more flexible on the server side. I'm looking at adding clustering support, and making the core pub-sub engine pluggable so you could use Faye as a stateless web frontend for another pub-sub system like Redis or AMQP.
I hope this has been helpful.
",4893720,168143.0,2011-02-04 01:36:54+00:00,,93,Faye vs. Socket.IO (and Juggernaut),"Socket.IO seems to be the most popular and active WebSocket emulation library. Juggernaut uses it to create a complete pub/sub system.
Faye is also popular and active, and has its own javascript library, making its complete functionality comparable to Juggernaut. Juggernaut uses node for its server, and Faye can use either node or rack. Juggernaut uses Redis for persistence (correction: it uses Redis for pub/sub), and Faye only keeps state in memory.

Is everything above accurate?
Faye says it implements Bayeux -- i think Juggernaut does not do this -- is that because Juggernaut is lower level (IE, I can implement Bayeux using Juggernaut)
Could Faye switch to using the Socket.IO browser javascript library if it wanted to? Or do their javascript libraries do fundamentally different things?
Are there any other architectural/design/philosophy differences between the projects?

26717978,827263.0,2014-11-03 15:57:57+00:00,26717870,76,"bash looks at the value of $argv[0] (bash is implemented in C) to determine how it was invoked.
Its behavior when invoked as sh is documented in the manual:

If Bash is invoked with the name sh, it tries to mimic the startup
  behavior of historical versions of sh as closely as possible, while
  conforming to the POSIX standard as well.
When invoked as an interactive login shell, or as a non-interactive
  shell with the -login option, it first attempts to read and execute
  commands from /etc/profile and ~/.profile, in that order. The
  --noprofile option may be used to inhibit this behavior. When invoked as an interactive shell with the name sh, Bash looks for the variable
  ENV, expands its value if it is defined, and uses the expanded value
  as the name of a file to read and execute. Since a shell invoked as sh
  does not attempt to read and execute commands from any other startup
  files, the --rcfile option has no effect. A non-interactive shell
  invoked with the name sh does not attempt to read any other startup
  files.
When invoked as sh, Bash enters POSIX mode after the startup files are
  read

There's a long list (currently 46 items) of things that change when bash is in POSIX mode, documented here.
(POSIX mode is probably useful mostly as a way to test scripts for portability to non-bash shells.)
Incidentally, programs that change their behavior depending on the name under which they were invoked are fairly common. Some versions of grep, fgrep, and egrep are implemented as a single executable (though GNU grep doesn't do this). view is typically a symbolic link to vi or vim; invoking it as view causes to open in read-only mode. The Busybox system includes a number of individual commands that are all symlinks to the master busybox executable.

My connection to the database is through NHibernate...and my usual method of creating such a test would be to do the following:
NHibernateSession.BeginTransaction();

//use nhibernate to insert objects into database
//retrieve objects via my method
//verify actual objects returned are the same as those inserted

NHibernateSession.RollbackTransaction();

However, I've recently found out about TransactionScope which apparently can be used for this very purpose...
Some example code I've found is as follows:
public static int AddDepartmentWithEmployees(Department dept)
{

    int res = 0;

    DepartmentAdapter deptAdapter = new DepartmentAdapter();
    EmployeeAdapter empAdapter = new EmployeeAdapter();
    using (TransactionScope txScope = new TransactionScope())
    {

        res += deptAdapter.Insert(dept.DepartmentName);
        //Custom method made to return Department ID 
        //after inserting the department ""Identity Column""
        dept.DepartmentID = deptAdapter.GetInsertReturnValue();
        foreach(Employee emp in dept.Employees)
        {

            emp.EmployeeDeptID = dept.DepartmentID;
            res += empAdapter.Insert(emp.EmployeeName, emp.EmployeeDeptID);

        }
        txScope.Complete();

    }
    return res;

}

I believe that if I don't include the line txScope.Complete() that the data inserted will be rolled back. But unfortunately I don't understand how that is possible... how does the txScope object keep a track of the deptAdapter and empAdapter objects and their transactions on the database.
I feel like I'm missing a bit of information here...am I really able to replace my BeginTransaction() and RollbackTransaction() calls by surrounding my code using TransactionScope?
If not, how then does TransactionScope work to roll back transactions?

What is interesting with that last set of shortcuts is:

  So I guess they heard you.
  It works just as you expect, tabs going from left to right and vice-versa, not on a history basis or some nonsense like that.

Matt Ball confirms:

but
[self performBlock:^{

Because an object retains its blocks, and a block retains it's objects. So in both these cases, the object which performs the block owns the block, which also owns the object. So you have a loop - a retain cycle. which means the memory is leaked.
In the example you have given - you're looking at a class method. You're calling the block on a UIView class, not a UIView object. A class has no memory associated with it. And you are probably calling this function from a controller, so the self reference is being retained by the block, but there is no loop because self is not retaining the block.
In the same way that, you may have noticed, not all objects that are used in the block need to be weakly referenced - just the ones that cause a retain cycle.

        } completion:^(BOOL finished) {
            [self anyFunction];

You can pass [self anyFunction] in the completion block without a warning. But if you write your own method with a completion block, the following warning occurs: capturing 'self' strongly in this block is likely to lead to a retain cycle.
A working solution is quite simple (iOS 5 + ARC). Before the block declare:
__weak MyClass *weakSelf = self;

and in the completion block you have to call:
[weakSelf anyFunction];

But, back to my Question: Why there is no need in the System Framework APIs to use a __weak object and to use self without any warnings. And how to implement a method without the need of a __weak object in the block?

.hover(): source
Bind one or two handlers to the matched elements, to be executed when the mouse pointer enters and leaves the elements.

The standard approach is to retry the request a few times.  If it doesn't go through, alert the user to check the connection, and fail gracefully.
Sidenote: To put the entire application in an ""offline"" state may lead to a lot of error-prone work of handling state.. wireless connections may come and go, etc.  So your best bet may be to just fail gracefully, preserve the data, and alert the user.. allowing them to eventually fix the connection problem if there is one, and to continue using your app with a fair amount of forgiveness.
Sidenote: You could check a reliable site like google for connectivity, but this may not be entirely useful as just trying to make your own request, because while google may be available, your own application may not be, and you're still going to have to handle your own connection problem.  Trying to send a ping to google would be a good way to confirm that the internet connection itself is down, so if that information is useful to you, then it might be worth the trouble.
Sidenote: Sending a Ping could be achieved in the same way that you would make any kind of two-way ajax request, but sending a ping to google in this case would pose some challenges.  First, we'd have the same cross-domain issues that are typically encountered in making ajax communications.  One option is to set up a server-side proxy, wherein we actually ping google (or whatever site), and return the results of the ping to the app.. This is a catch-22, because if the internet connection is actually the problem, we won't be able to get to the server, and if the connection problem is only on our own domain, we won't be able to tell the difference. Other cross-domain techniques could be tried, for example, embedding an iframe in your page which points to google.com, and then polling the iframe for success/failure (examine the contents, etc).  Embedding an image may not really tell us anything, because we need a useful response from the communication mechanism in order to draw a good conclusion about what's going on.  So again, determining the state of the internet connection as a whole may be more trouble than it's worth.  You'll have to weight these options out for your specific app.

null for all columns as in SELECT * FROM ...
new String[] { ""column1"", ""column2"", ... } for specific columns as in SELECT column1, column2 FROM ... - you can also put complex expressions here:
new String[] { ""(SELECT max(column1) FROM table1) AS max"" } would give you a column named max holding the max value of column1

whereClause

the part you put after WHERE without that keyword, e.g. ""column1 > 5""
should include ? for things that are dynamic, e.g. ""column1=?"" -> see whereArgs

whereArgs

specify the content that fills each ? in whereClause in the order they appear

the others

just like whereClause the statement after the keyword or null if you don't use it.

Example
String[] tableColumns = new String[] {
    ""column1"",
    ""(SELECT max(column1) FROM table2) AS max""
};
String whereClause = ""column1 = ? OR column1 = ?"";
String[] whereArgs = new String[] {
    ""value1"",
    ""value2""
};
String orderBy = ""column1"";
Cursor c = sqLiteDatabase.query(""table1"", tableColumns, whereClause, whereArgs,
        null, null, orderBy);

// since we have a named column we can do
int idx = c.getColumnIndex(""max"");

is equivalent to the following raw query
String queryString =
    ""SELECT column1, (SELECT max(column1) FROM table1) AS max FROM table1 "" +
    ""WHERE column1 = ? OR column1 = ? ORDER BY column1"";
sqLiteDatabase.rawQuery(queryString, whereArgs);


By using the Where/Bind -Args version you get automatically escaped values and you don't have to worry if input-data contains '.
Unsafe: String whereClause = ""column1='"" + value + ""'"";
Safe: String whereClause = ""column1=?"";
because if value contains a ' your statement either breaks and you get exceptions or does unintended things, for example value = ""XYZ'; DROP TABLE table1;--"" might even drop your table since the statement would become two statements and a comment:
SELECT * FROM table1 where column1='XYZ'; DROP TABLE table1;--'

using the args version XYZ'; DROP TABLE table1;-- would be escaped to 'XYZ''; DROP TABLE table1;--' and would only be treated as a value. Even if the ' is not intended to do bad things it is still quite common that people have it in their names or use it in texts, filenames, passwords etc. So always use the args version. (It is okay to build int and other primitives directly into whereClause though)

24066445,563473.0,2014-06-05 17:25:04+00:00,23935810,194,"There are two distinct uses of mipmaps.
1) For launcher icons when building density specific APKs. Some developers build separate APKs for every density, to keep the APK size down. However some launchers (shipped with some devices, or available on the Play Store) use larger icon sizes than the standard 48dp. Launchers use getDrawableForDensity and scale down if needed, rather than up, so the icons are high quality. For example on an hdpi tablet the launcher might load the xhdpi icon. By placing your launcher icon in the mipmap-xhdpi directory, it will not be stripped the way a drawable-xhdpi directory is when building an APK for hdpi devices. If you're building a single APK for all devices, then this doesn't really matter as the launcher can access the drawable resources for the desired density.
2) The actual mipmap API from 4.3. I haven't used this and am not familiar with it. It's not used by the Android Open Source Project launchers and I'm not aware of any other launcher using.
",23935810,383414.0,2014-05-29 14:29:25+00:00,,328,mipmap drawables for icons,"Since Android 4.3 we can now make use of the res/mipmap folders to store ""mipmap"" images.
e.g. Chrome for Android stores its icons in these folders instead of the more normal res/drawable folders.
How are these mipmap images different from the other familiar drawable images?
I see that in my manifest, we use the @mipmap/ qualifier, instead of @drawable/, which makes sense given the resource folder name:
<activity
    android:name="".MipmapDemp""
    android:icon=""@mipmap/ic_launcher"" />


References:
The Android 4.3 APIs document has the following to say:

Using a mipmap as the source for your bitmap or drawable is a simple
  way to provide a quality image and various image scales, which can be
  particularly useful if you expect your image to be scaled during an
  animation.
Android 4.2 (API level 17) added support for mipmaps in the Bitmap
  classâAndroid swaps the mip images in your Bitmap when you've supplied
  a mipmap source and have enabled setHasMipMap(). Now in Android 4.3,
  you can enable mipmaps for a BitmapDrawable object as well, by
  providing a mipmap asset and setting the android:mipMap attribute in a
  bitmap resource file or by calling hasMipMap().

I don't see anything in there that helps me to understand?

XML Bitmap resources have an android:mipMap property:

Boolean. Enables or disables the mipmap hint. See setHasMipMap() for
  more information. Default value is false.

This does not apply to launcher icons as far as I can see.

The question was raised on Google Groups (The purpose of resource name ""mipmap""?!), to which Romain Guy replied:

It's useful to provide an image at a larger resolution that would
  normally be computed (for instance, on an mdpi device, Launcher might
  want the larger hdpi icon to display large app shortcuts.)

I feel like this almost makes sense of it, but not quite.
I'm still inclined to go with Randy Sugianto's follow up:

What are the advantages of this?  Is there any guide how to use
  mipmaps,  probably for better launcher icons?


Of course, Wikipedia has a page for ""Mipmap"", which refers to an older technique invented in 1983, that I can't quite relate to the current Android implementation.

Should we be storing all our app icons in res/mipmap folders these days, and what are the guidelines for these mipmap images?

Update #1 
Here's a blog post that tries to explain it a bit. 

Mipmapping for drawables in Android 4.3

But the image used in that blog post shows what looks like 1 file with many logo's in it. This is not what I see in Chrome's mipmap folder. 
Chrome's mipmap-hdpi folder contains 3 images. One is the Chrome logo, on its own.

Strangely, it is 72x72, not 48x48 which I would expect to see. 
Perhaps that is all there is to this - we just need to keep bigger icons in the mipmap folders?

Update #2
The Android Developers Blog post of 23/10/2014 again confirms the idea of using the mipmap folders for application icons:

Getting Your Apps Ready for Nexus 6 and Nexus 9

When talking about the Nexus 6 screen density, the author writes:

Itâs best practice to place your app icons in mipmap- folders (not the
  drawable- folders) because they are used at resolutions different from
  the deviceâs current density. For example, an xxxhdpi app icon can be
  used on the launcher for an xxhdpi device.


Update #3
Note that Android Studio creates the ic_launcher.png icons in the mipmap... folders rather than the drawable... folders that Eclipse used to create them in.

First, let's see what this does:
Arrays.asList(ia)

It takes an array ia and creates a wrapper that implements List<Integer>, which makes the original array available as a list. Nothing is copied and all, only a single wrapper object is created. Operations on the list wrapper are propagated to the original array. This means that if you shuffle the list wrapper, the original array is shuffled as well, if you overwrite an element, it gets overwritten in the original array, etc. Of course, some List operations aren't allowed on the wrapper, like adding or removing elements from the list, you can only read or overwrite the elements.
Note that the list wrapper doesn't extend ArrayList - it's a different kind of object. ArrayLists have their own, internal array, in which they store their elements, and are able to resize the internal arrays etc. The wrapper doesn't have its own internal array, it only propagates operations to the array given to it.
On the other hand, if you subsequently create a new array as 
new ArrayList<Integer>(Arrays.asList(ia))

then you create new ArrayList, which is a full, independent copy of the original one. Although here you create the wrapper using Arrays.asList as well, it is used only during the construction of the new ArrayList and is garbage-collected afterwards. The structure of this new ArrayList is completely independent of the original array. It contains the same elements (both the original array and this new ArrayList reference the same integers in memory), but it creates a new, internal array, that holds the references. So when you shuffle it, add, remove elements etc., the original array is unchanged.

These are objects, not classes.

The logging module is smart enough to not produce the complete log message unless the message actually gets logged somewhere.
To apply this feature to your specific request, you could create a lazyjoin class.

1181106,139937.0,2009-07-25 03:25:46+00:00,1180550,59,"I ran in to this problem, and one day I decided to dig in to it.
The short non-answer but pragmatic solution:
A way to work around this ""problem"" is to use a semi-colon, ;, right after the colon of a case ...: statement.  For example, using the example you provided, it can be ""fixed"" so it compiles and behaves as you would intuitively expect it to:
    case 1:; // <- Note semi-colon.
            UIImagePickerController *imagePicker = [[UIImagePickerController alloc] init];
            imagePicker.delegate = self;

The long answer:
Some history: Previously, C only allowed you to declare ""block local"" variables at the start of a block, which was then followed by various statements.  C99 changed things so you could freely intermix variable declarations and statements.
In the context of the C99 BNF grammar, a variable declaration is a declaration, and a statement is a statement.  A statement means multiple things, one of those is known as a compound-statement, which is the familiar { ... } block.  The ... part is loosely defined as zero or more block-items, with a block-item being defined loosely as either a declaration or a statement.
The problem lies in the way a labeled-statement (a goto label, case label, or default:, essentially the ...: statements) is defined, which is loosely defined ...: zero or more statements.  It is not, as one might intuitively expect, zero or more statements or declarations.  The use of a ; right after the labeled-statements : essentially terminates the zero or more statements part of a labeled-statement.  This causes the grammar to fall back to the compound-statement definition, which allows for the next ""statement"" to be either a statement or declaration.
I have not investigated whether or not this is an unintentional over-sight of the C99 language spec (in practical terms, a bug in the C99 standard), or if this is a pragmatic concession to the complexities of writing language grammars.  If you're not familiar with writing grammars, you'll notice that the above explanation allows for recursion: A labeled-statement can match case 1: case 2: case 3:.  In overly simplistic terms(1), some types of grammar recursion are simple and ""unambiguous"", while others are complex and ""ambiguous"".  For simplicity, most language tools will only handle the case where any ambiguity must be deterministically resolved by looking at nothing more than ""the next token"".  I mention this only because while this might intuitively seem like a deficiency in the C99 spec, there may be compelling, non-obvious reasons why this exists... and I haven't bothered to do any further research on the subject to find out either way.
(1) This is not meant to be a technically accurate description, but a reasonable approximation for those not familiar with the issues involved.
EDIT:
The solution I gave works in ""most"" cases (cases being ""usages"", not switch cases), but it does fail in one case: This will not work when the declaration declares a C99 variable length array, such as case 1:; void *ptrs[count];  This is because in C99 it is an error to ""jump past"" the declaration of a C99 VLA that is in the same lexical scope where the jump took place.  In these cases, you need to use case 1: { void *ptrs[count]; }.  In this case, the scope of the ptrs VLA ends at the closing }.  This is more complicated than it first appears because the following is perfectly legal C code, though at first glance one would intuitively think it isn't:
switch(3){
  case 0:
    printf(""case 0\n"");
    break;
  case 1:;
    int *ip = NULL;
    printf(""case 1\n"");
    break;
  case 2:
    {
      int ia[6];
      printf(""case 2\n"");
      break;
      case 3:
        printf(""case 3\n"");
        break;
      default:
        printf(""default\n"");
    }
}

This compiles, and when run, prints case 3.

This could include anything you want - e.g. program features to enable, expiry date, name of the user (if you want to bind it to a user). Then encrypt that using some crypto algorithm with a fixed key or hash it. Then you just verify it within your program. One way to distribute the license file (on windows) is to provide it as a file which updates the registry (saves the user having to type it).
Beware of false sense of security though - sooner or later someone will simply patch your program to skip that check, and distribute the patched version. Or, they will work out a key that passes all checks and distribute that, or backdate the clock, etc. It doesn't matter how convoluted you make your scheme, anything you do for this will ultimately be security through obscurity and they will always be able to this. Even if they can't someone will, and will distribute the hacked version. Same applies even if you supply a dongle - if someone wants to, they can patch out the check for that too. Digitally signing your code won't help, they can remove that signature, or resign it.
You can complicate matters a bit by using techniques to prevent the program running in a debugger etc, but even this is not bullet proof. So you should just make it difficult enough that an honest user will not forget to pay. Also be very careful that your scheme does not become obtrusive to paying users - it's better to have some ripped off copies than for your paying customers not to be able to use what they have paid for.
Another option is to have an online check - just provide the user with a unique ID, and check online as to what capabilities that ID should have, and cache it for some period. All the same caveats apply though - people can get round anything like this.
Consider also the support costs of having to deal with users who have forgotten their key, etc.
edit: I just want to add, don't invest too much time in this or think that somehow your convoluted scheme will be different and uncrackable. It won't, and cannot be as long as people control the hardware and OS your program runs on. Developers have been trying to come up with ever more complex schemes for this, thinking that if they develop their own system for it then it will be known only to them and therefore 'more secure'. But it really is the programming equivalent of trying to build a perpetual motion machine. :-)

That means, the operator overloaded member function gets invoked on the first operand. That is how member functions work!
But what if the first operand is not a class? There's a major problem if we want to overload an operator where the first operand is not a class type, rather say double. So you cannot write like this  10.0 + s2. However, you can write operator overloaded member function for expressions like s1 + 10.0.
To solve this ordering problem, we define operator overloaded function as friend IF it needs to access private members. Make it friend ONLY when it needs to access private members. Otherwise simply make it non-friend non-member function to improve encapsulation! 
class Sample
{
 public:
    Sample operator + (const Sample& op2); //works with s1 + s2
    Sample operator + (double op2); //works with s1 + 10.0

   //Make it `friend` only when it needs to access private members. 
   //Otherwise simply make it **non-friend non-member** function.

For the first case, you can use the Mono Migration Analyzer tool (Moma) to evaluate how far your application is from running on Mono.  If the evaluation comes back with flying colors, you should start on your testing and QA and get ready to ship.
If your evaluation comes back with a report highlighting features that are missing or differ significantly in their semantics in Mono you will have to evaluate whether the code can be adapted, rewritten or in the worst case whether your application can work with reduced functionality.      
According to our Moma statistics based on user submissions (this is from memory) about 50% of the applications work out of the box, about 25% require about a week worth of work (refactoring, adapting) another 15% require a serious commitment to redo chunks of your code, and the rest is just not worth bothering porting since they are so incredibly tied to Win32.   At that point, either you start from zero, or a business decision will drive the effort to make your code portable, but we are talking months worth of work (at least from the reports we have).
If you are starting from scratch, the situation is a lot simpler, because you will only be using the APIs that are present in Mono.   As long as you stay with the supported stack (which is pretty much .NET 2.0, plus all the core upgrades in 3.5 including LINQ and System.Core, plus any of the Mono cross-platform APIs) you will be fine.  
Every once in a while you might run into bugs in Mono or limitations, and you might have to work around them, but that is not different than any other system.
As for portability: ASP.NET applications are the easier ones to port, as those have little to no dependencies on Win32 and you can even use SQL server or other popular databases (there are plenty of bundled database providers with Mono).   
Windows.Forms porting is sometimes trickier because developers like to escape the .NET sandbox and P/Invoke their brains out to configure things as useful as the changing the cursor blinking rate expressed as two bezier points encoded in BCD form in a wParam.   Or some junk like that.

(Note: did you use a passphrase for your ssh keys ? It would be easier without a passphrase)
Check also the url used when pushing (git@github.com/..., not git://github.com/...)

When the program ends, it'll drop you back to the cmd prompt instead of closing the window.
Add code to wait at the end of your script. Adding ...
raw_input()

... at the end of the script makes it wait for the Enter key. That method is annoying because you have to modify the script, and have to remember removing it when you're done. Specially annoying when testing other people's scripts.
Use an editor that pauses for you. Some editors prepared for python will automatically pause for you after execution. Other editors allow you to configure the command line it uses to run your program. I find it particularly useful to configure it as ""python -i myscript.py"" when running. That drops you to a python shell after the end of the program, with the program environment loaded, so you may further play with the variables and call functions and methods.

So, what contentious opinions do you hold? I'd rather avoid the kind of thing which ends up being pretty religious with relatively little basis (e.g. brace placing) but examples might include things like ""unit testing isn't actually terribly helpful"" or ""public fields are okay really"".

Stephen Toub, a member of the Microsoft pfx team has this to say:

Task.Dispose exists due to Task
  potentially wrapping an event handle
  used when waiting on the task to
  complete, in the event the waiting
  thread actually has to block (as
  opposed to spinning or potentially
  executing the task it's waiting on). 
  If all you're doing is using
  continuations, that event handle will
  never be allocated
  ...
  it's likely better to rely on finalization to take care of things.

Update (Oct 2012)
Stephen Toub has posted a blog titled Do I need to dispose of Tasks? which gives some more detail, and explains the improvements in .Net 4.5.
In summary: You don't need to dispose of Task objects 99% of the time.
There are two main reasons to dispose an object: to free up unmanaged resources in a timely, deterministic way, and to avoid the cost of running the object's finalizer. Neither of these apply to Task most of the time:

As of .Net 4.5, the only time a Task allocates the internal wait handle (the only unmanaged resource in the Task object) is when you explicitly use the IAsyncResult.AsyncWaitHandle of the Task, and
The Task object itself doesn't have a finalizer; the handle is itself wrapped in an object with a finalizer, so unless it's allocated, there's no finalizer to run.

",3734280,119738.0,2010-09-17 09:51:58+00:00,,87,Is it considered acceptable to not call Dispose() on a TPL Task object?,"I want to trigger a task to run on a background thread. I don't want to wait on the tasks completion.
In .net 3.5 I would have done this:
ThreadPool.QueueUserWorkItem(d => { DoSomething(); });

In .net 4 the TPL is the suggested way. The common pattern I have seen recommended is:
Task.Factory.StartNew(() => { DoSomething(); });

However, the StartNew() method returns a Task object which implements IDisposable. This 
seems to be overlooked by people who recommend this pattern. The MSDN documentation on the Task.Dispose() method says:

""Always call Dispose before you release your last reference to the Task.""

You can't call dispose on a task until it is completed, so having the main thread wait and call dispose would defeat the point of doing on a background thread in the first place. There also doesn't seem to be any completed/finished event that could be used for cleanup.
The MSDN page on the Task class doesn't comment on this, and the book ""Pro C#2010..."" recommends the same pattern and makes no comment on task disposal.
I know if I just leave it the finalizer will catch it in the end, but is this going to come back and bite me when I'm doing lots of fire & forget tasks like this and the finalizer thread gets overwhelmed?
So my questions are: 

Is it acceptable to not call Dispose() on the Task class in this case? And if so, why and are there risks/consequences?
Is there any documentation that discusses this? 
Or is there an appropriate way of disposing of the Task object that I've missed?
Or is there another way of doing fire & forget tasks with the TPL?

Note that I'm still learning Mercurial, and I'd like pointers if something I say is wrong, using the wrong terminology, could be done better, etc.
No further changes, merge not shared (no pushes/pulls)
The programmer has merged, but not done anything else, nor has (s)he shared the changes with anyone, in any way
In this case, simply discard the local clone, and get a fresh clone from a safe repository.
Local changes on top of merge, not shared
The programmer has merged, and continued working based on that merge. The changesets that followed the merge should be kept, but the merge itself should be removed. The changes (merge + following changesets) have not been shared with anyone 
In this case I would do one of four:

Try to use the REBASE extension, this will move the changesets from one location to another. If the changesets are based on code-changes that were introduced with the merge, some manual work must be done to reconcile the differences.
Try to use the MQ extension to pull the changesets that are to be kept into a patch-queue, then push them back in a different location. This will, however, have the same problem as the REBASE extension in terms of changes based on the merge
Try to use the TRANSPLANT extension to ""copy"" the changes from one location to another. Still, same problem exists as with the first two.
Do the work again, probably with the help of a diffing tool to take changes done in the changesets I want to discard, and re-do them in the correct location.

To get rid of the merge changeset + all the following changesets, there's a couple of options:

Use the strip command in the MQ extension
hg strip <hash of merge changeset>

Clone and pull, and specify the hash of the changesets leading up to, but not including the merge. In essence, create a new clone by pulling from the damaged clone into a new one, and avoid pulling in the merge you don't want.
hg clone damaged -r <hash of first parent> .
hg pull damaged -r <hash of second parent>


Merge pushed to others, control over clones
The programmer has pushed to master repository, or to someone else, or someone pulled from the programmers repository. However, you (as in the group of developers) have control over all the repositories, as in, you can contact and talk to everyone before more work is done
In this case, I would see if step 1 or 2 could be done, but it might have to be done in a lot of places, so this might involve a lot of work.
If nobody has done work based on the merge changeset, I would use step 1 or 2 to clean up, then push to the master repository, and ask everyone to get a fresh clone from the master repository.
Merge pushed, you don't have control over clones
The programmer pushed the mergeset, and you don't know who will have the merge changeset. In other words, if you succeed in eradicating it from your repositories, a stray push from someone who still has it will bring it back.
Ignore the merge changeset and work in the two branches as though it never happened. This will leave a dangling head. You can then later, when you've merged the two branches, do a null-merge for this head to get rid of it.
  M         <-- this is the one you want to disregard
 / \
*   *
|   |
*   *
|   |

Simply continue working in the two branches:
|   |
*   *
| M |       <-- this is the one you want to disregard
|/ \|
*   *
|   |
*   *
|   |

Then later you merge the two, the real merge you want:
  m
 / \
*   *
|   |
*   *
| M |       <-- this is the one you want to disregard
|/ \|
*   *
|   |
*   *
|   |

You can then do a null-merge to get rid of the dangling head. Unfortunately I don't know how to do that except through TortoiseHg. It has a checkbox where I can discard the changes from one of the branches.
With TortoiseHg, I would update to the merge I want to keep (the topmost, lowercase m), then select and right-click on the dangling merge head below, and then check the ""Discard all changes from merge target (other) revision"":

Getting integer arithmetic correct is hard. As has been demonstrated amply thus far, the moment you try to do a ""clever"" trick, odds are good that you've made a mistake.  And when a flaw is found, changing the code to fix the flaw without considering whether the fix breaks something else is not a good problem-solving technique.  So far we've had I think five different incorrect integer arithmetic solutions to this completely not-particularly-difficult problem posted.
The right way to approach integer arithmetic problems -- that is, the way that increases the likelihood of getting the answer right the first time - is to approach the problem carefully, solve it one step at a time, and use good engineering principles in doing so.
Start by reading the specification for what you're trying to replace. The specification for integer division clearly states:

The division rounds the result towards zero
The result is zero or positive when the two operands have the same sign and zero or negative when the two operands have opposite signs
If the left operand is the smallest representable int and the right operand is â1, an overflow occurs. [...] it is implementation-defined as to whether [an ArithmeticException] is thrown or the overflow goes unreported with the resulting value being that of the left operand.
If the value of the right operand is zero, a System.DivideByZeroException is thrown.

What we want is an integer division function which computes the quotient but rounds the result always upwards, not always towards zero. 
So write a specification for that function. Our function int DivRoundUp(int dividend, int divisor) must have behaviour defined for every possible input. That undefined behaviour is deeply worrying, so let's eliminate it. We'll say that our operation has this specification:

operation throws if divisor is zero
operation throws if dividend is int.minval and divisor is -1
if there is no remainder -- division is 'even' -- then the return value is the integral quotient
Otherwise it returns the smallest integer that is greater than the quotient, that is, it always rounds up.

Now we have a specification, so we know we can come up with a testable design.  Suppose we add an additional design criterion that the problem be solved solely with integer arithmetic, rather than computing the quotient as a double, since the ""double"" solution has been explicitly rejected in the problem statement.
So what must we compute?  Clearly, to meet our spec while remaining solely in integer arithmetic, we need to know three facts. First, what was the integer quotient? Second, was the division free of remainder? And third, if not, was the integer quotient computed by rounding up or down?
Now that we have a specification and a design, we can start writing code.
public static int DivRoundUp(int dividend, int divisor)
{
  if (divisor == 0 ) throw ...
  if (divisor == -1 && dividend == Int32.MinValue) throw ...
  int roundedTowardsZeroQuotient = dividend / divisor;
  bool dividedEvenly = (dividend % divisor) == 0;
  if (dividedEvenly) 
    return roundedTowardsZeroQuotient;

  // At this point we know that divisor was not zero 
  // (because we would have thrown) and we know that 
  // dividend was not zero (because there would have been no remainder)
  // Therefore both are non-zero.  Either they are of the same sign, 
  // or opposite signs. If they're of opposite sign then we rounded 
  // UP towards zero so we're done. If they're of the same sign then 
  // we rounded DOWN towards zero, so we need to add one.

  bool wasRoundedDown = ((divisor > 0) == (dividend > 0));
  if (wasRoundedDown) 
    return roundedTowardsZeroQuotient + 1;
  else
    return roundedTowardsZeroQuotient;
}

Is this clever? No. Beautiful? No. Short? No. Correct according to the specification? I believe so, but I have not fully tested it. It looks pretty good though. 
We're professionals here; use good engineering practices. Research your tools, specify the desired behaviour, consider error cases first, and write the code to emphasize its obvious correctness. And when you find a bug, consider whether your algorithm is deeply flawed to begin with before you just randomly start swapping the directions of comparisons around and break stuff that already works.

Now if someone refactors the name of the input parameter the exception will be kept up to date too.
It is also useful in some places where previously reflection had to be used to get the names of properties or parameters.
In your example nameof(T) gets the name of the type parameter - this can be useful too:
throw new ArgumentException(nameof(T), $""Type {typeof(T)} does not support this method."");


Another use of nameof is for enums - usually if you want the string name of an enum you use .ToString():
enum MyEnum { ... FooBar = 7 ... }

Console.WriteLine(MyEnum.FooBar.ToString());

> ""FooBar""

This is actually relatively slow as .Net holds the enum value (i.e. 7) and finds the name at run time.
Instead use nameof:
Console.WriteLine(nameof(MyEnum.FooBar))

> ""FooBar""

Now .Net replaces the enum name with a string at compile time.

Yet another use is for things like INotifyPropertyChanged and logging - in both cases you want the name of the member that you're calling to be passed to another method:
// Property with notify of change
public int Foo

7273375,896145.0,2011-09-01 16:28:26+00:00,7267760,83,"Another way to explain it is this: no function can get the current time (since it keeps changing), but an action can get the current time. Let's say that getClockTime is a constant (or a nullary function, if you like) which represents the action of getting the current time. This action is the same every time no matter when it is used so it is a real constant. 
Likewise, let's say print is a function which takes some time representation and prints it to the console. Since function calls cannot have side effects in pure functional language, we instead imagine that it is a function which takes a timestamp and returns the action of printing it to the console. Again, this is a real function, because if you give it the same timestamp, it will return the same action of printing it every time.
Now, how can you print the current time to the console? Well, you have to combine the two actions. So how can we do that? We cannot just pass getClockTime to print, since print expects a timestamp, not an action. But we can imagine that there is an operator, >>=, which combines two actions, one which gets a timestamp, and one which takes one as argument and prints it. Applying this to the actions previously mentioned, the result is... tadaaa... a new action which gets the current time and prints it. And this is incidently exactly how it is done in Haskell.

So, conceptually, you can view it in this way: A pure functional program does not perform any IO, it defines an action, which the runtime system then executes. The action is the same every time, but the result of executing it depends on the circumstances of when it is executed.
I don't know if this was any clearer than the other explanations, but it sometimes helps me to think of it this way.

It's exactly like mathematical function which evaluates to same output for same value of input parameter which involves in the function expression. 
For example, consider this:
f(x,y) = x*x + y; //it is a mathematical function

No matter how many times you use f(10,4), its value will always be 104. As such, wherever you've written f(10,4), you can replace it with 104, without altering the value of the whole expression. This property is referred to as referential transparency of an expression.
As Wikipedia says (link),

Conversely, in functional code, the output value of a function depends only on the arguments that are input to the function, so calling a function f twice with the same value for an argument x will produce the same result f(x) both times. 

So my question is: can a time function (which returns the current time) exist in functional programming? 

If yes, then how can it exist? Does it not violate the principle of functional programming? It particularly violates referential transparency which is one of the property of functional programming (if I correctly understand it).
Or if no, then how can one know the current time in functional programming?

Introduction
Move semantics allows an object, under certain conditions, to take ownership of some other object's external resources. This is important in two ways:

Turning expensive copies into cheap moves. See my first answer for an example. Note that if an object does not manage at least one external resource (either directly, or indirectly through its member objects), move semantics will not offer any advantages over copy semantics. In that case, copying an object and moving an object means the exact same thing:
class cannot_benefit_from_move_semantics
{
    int a;        // moving an int means copying an int
    float b;      // moving a float means copying a float
    double c;     // moving a double means copying a double
    char d[64];   // moving a char array means copying a char array

    // ...
};

Implementing safe ""move-only"" types; that is, types for which copying does not make sense, but moving does.  Examples include locks, file handles, and smart pointers with unique ownership semantics. Note: This answer discusses std::auto_ptr, a deprecated C++98 standard library template, which was replaced by std::unique_ptr in C++11. Intermediate C++ programmers are probably at least somewhat familiar with std::auto_ptr, and because of the ""move semantics"" it displays, it seems like a good starting point for discussing move semantics in C++11. YMMV.

What is a move?
The C++98 standard library offers a smart pointer with unique ownership semantics called std::auto_ptr<T>. In case you are unfamiliar with auto_ptr, its purpose is to guarantee that a dynamically allocated object is always released, even in the face of exceptions:
{
    std::auto_ptr<Shape> a(new Triangle);
    // ...
    // arbitrary code, could throw exceptions
    // ...
}   // <--- when a goes out of scope, the triangle is deleted automatically

The unusual thing about auto_ptr is its ""copying"" behavior:
auto_ptr<Shape> a(new Triangle);

      +---------------+
      | triangle data |
      +---------------+
        ^
        |
        |
        |
  +-----|---+
  |   +-|-+ |
a | p | | | |
  |   +---+ |
  +---------+

auto_ptr<Shape> b(a);

      +---------------+
      | triangle data |
      +---------------+
        ^
        |
        +----------------------+
                               |
  +---------+            +-----|---+
  |   +---+ |            |   +-|-+ |
a | p |   | |          b | p | | | |
  |   +---+ |            |   +---+ |
  +---------+            +---------+

Note how the initialization of b with a does not copy the triangle, but instead transfers the ownership of the triangle from a to b. We also say ""a is moved into b"" or ""the triangle is moved from a to b"". This may sound confusing, because the triangle itself always stays at the same place in memory.

To move an object means to transfer ownership of some resource it manages to another object.

The copy constructor of auto_ptr probably looks something like this (somewhat simplified):
auto_ptr(auto_ptr& source)   // note the missing const
{
    p = source.p;
    source.p = 0;   // now the source no longer owns the object
}

Dangerous and harmless moves
The dangerous thing about auto_ptr is that what syntactically looks like a copy is actually a move. Trying to call a member function on a moved-from auto_ptr will invoke undefined behavior, so you have to be very careful not to use an auto_ptr after it has been moved from:
auto_ptr<Shape> a(new Triangle);   // create triangle
auto_ptr<Shape> b(a);              // move a into b
double area = a->area();           // undefined behavior

But auto_ptr is not always dangerous. Factory functions are a perfectly fine use case for auto_ptr:
auto_ptr<Shape> make_triangle()
{
    return auto_ptr<Shape>(new Triangle);
}

auto_ptr<Shape> c(make_triangle());      // move temporary into c
double area = make_triangle()->area();   // perfectly safe

Note how both examples follow the same syntactic pattern:
auto_ptr<Shape> variable(expression);
double area = expression->area();

And yet, one of them invokes undefined behavior, whereas the other one does not. So what is the difference between the expressions a and make_triangle()? Aren't they both of the same type? Indeed they are, but they have different value categories.
Value categories
Obviously, there must be some profound difference between the expression a which denotes an auto_ptr variable, and the expression make_triangle() which denotes the call of a function that returns an auto_ptr by value, thus creating a fresh temporary auto_ptr object every time it is called. a is an example of an lvalue, whereas make_triangle() is an example of an rvalue.
Moving from lvalues such as a is dangerous, because we could later try to call a member function via a, invoking undefined behavior. On the other hand, moving from rvalues such as make_triangle() is perfectly safe, because after the copy constructor has done its job, we cannot use the temporary again. There is no expression that denotes said temporary; if we simply write make_triangle() again, we get a different temporary. In fact, the moved-from temporary is already gone on the next line:
auto_ptr<Shape> c(make_triangle());
                                  ^ the moved-from temporary dies right here

Note that the letters l and r have a historic origin in the left-hand side and right-hand side of an assignment. This is no longer true in C++, because there are lvalues which cannot appear on the left-hand side of an assignment (like arrays or user-defined types without an assignment operator), and there are rvalues which can (all rvalues of class types with an assignment operator).

An rvalue of class type is an expression whose evaluation creates a temporary object.
  Under normal circumstances, no other expression inside the same scope denotes the same temporary object.

Rvalue references
We now understand that moving from lvalues is potentially dangerous, but moving from rvalues is harmless. If C++ had language support to distinguish lvalue arguments from rvalue arguments, we could either completely forbid moving from lvalues, or at least make moving from lvalues explicit at call site, so that we no longer move by accident.
C++11's answer to this problem is rvalue references. An rvalue reference is a new kind of reference that only binds to rvalues, and the syntax is X&&. The good old reference X& is now known as an lvalue reference. (Note that X&& is not a reference to a reference; there is no such thing in C++.)
If we throw const into the mix, we already have four different kinds of references. What kinds of expressions of type X can they bind to?
            lvalue   const lvalue   rvalue   const rvalue
---------------------------------------------------------              
X&          yes
const X&    yes      yes            yes      yes
X&&                                 yes
const X&&                           yes      yes

In practice, you can forget about const X&&. Being restricted to read from rvalues is not very useful.

An rvalue reference X&& is a new kind of reference that only binds to rvalues.

Implicit conversions
Rvalue references went through several versions. Since version 2.1, an rvalue reference X&& also binds to all value categories of a different type Y, provided there is an implicit conversion from Y to X. In that case, a temporary of type X is created, and the rvalue reference is bound to that temporary:
void some_function(std::string&& r);

some_function(""hello world"");

In the above example, ""hello world"" is an lvalue of type const char[12]. Since there is an implicit conversion from const char[12] through const char* to std::string, a temporary of type std::string is created, and r is bound to that temporary. This is one of the cases where the distinction between rvalues (expressions) and temporaries (objects) is a bit blurry.
Move constructors
A useful example of a function with an X&& parameter is the move constructor X::X(X&& source). Its purpose is to transfer ownership of the managed resource from the source into the current object.
In C++11, std::auto_ptr<T> has been replaced by std::unique_ptr<T> which takes advantage of rvalue references. I will develop and discuss a simplified version of unique_ptr. First, we encapsulate a raw pointer and overload the operators -> and *, so our class feels like a pointer:
template<typename T>
class unique_ptr
{
    T* ptr;

public:

    T* operator->() const
    {
        return ptr;
    }

    T& operator*() const
    {
        return *ptr;
    }

The constructor takes ownership of the object, and the destructor deletes it:
    explicit unique_ptr(T* p = nullptr)
    {
        ptr = p;
    }

    ~unique_ptr()
    {
        delete ptr;
    }

Now comes the interesting part, the move constructor:
    unique_ptr(unique_ptr&& source)   // note the rvalue reference
    {
        ptr = source.ptr;
        source.ptr = nullptr;
    }

This move constructor does exactly what the auto_ptr copy constructor did, but it can only be supplied with rvalues:
unique_ptr<Shape> a(new Triangle);
unique_ptr<Shape> b(a);                 // error
unique_ptr<Shape> c(make_triangle());   // okay

The second line fails to compile, because a is an lvalue, but the parameter unique_ptr&& source can only be bound to rvalues. This is exactly what we wanted; dangerous moves should never be implicit. The third line compiles just fine, because make_triangle() is an rvalue. The move constructor will transfer ownership from the temporary to c. Again, this is exactly what we wanted.

The move constructor transfers ownership of a managed resource into the current object.

Move assignment operators
The last missing piece is the move assignment operator. Its job is to release the old resource and acquire the new resource from its argument:
    unique_ptr& operator=(unique_ptr&& source)   // note the rvalue reference
    {
        if (this != &source)    // beware of self-assignment
        {
            delete ptr;         // release the old resource

            ptr = source.ptr;   // acquire the new resource
            source.ptr = nullptr;
        }
        return *this;
    }
};

Note how this implementation of the move assignment operator duplicates logic of both the destructor and the move constructor. Are you familiar with the copy-and-swap idiom? It can also be applied to move semantics as the move-and-swap idiom:
    unique_ptr& operator=(unique_ptr source)   // note the missing reference
    {
        std::swap(ptr, source.ptr);
        return *this;
    }
};

Now that source is a variable of type unique_ptr, it will be initialized by the move constructor; that is, the argument will be moved into the parameter. The argument is still required to be an rvalue, because the move constructor itself has an rvalue reference parameter. When control flow reaches the closing brace of operator=, source goes out of scope, releasing the old resource automatically.

The move assignment operator transfers ownership of a managed resource into the current object, releasing the old resource.
  The move-and-swap idiom simplifies the implementation.

Moving from lvalues
Sometimes, we want to move from lvalues. That is, sometimes we want the compiler to treat an lvalue as if it were an rvalue, so it can invoke the move constructor, even though it could be potentially unsafe.
For this purpose, C++11 offers a standard library function template called std::move inside the header <utility>.
This name is a bit unfortunate, because std::move simply casts an lvalue to an rvalue; it does not move anything by itself. It merely enables moving. Maybe it should have been named std::cast_to_rvalue or std::enable_move, but we are stuck with the name by now.
Here is how you explicitly move from an lvalue:
unique_ptr<Shape> a(new Triangle);
unique_ptr<Shape> b(a);              // still an error
unique_ptr<Shape> c(std::move(a));   // okay

Note that after the third line, a no longer owns a triangle. That's okay, because by explicitly writing std::move(a), we made our intentions clear: ""Dear constructor, do whatever you want with a in order to initialize c; I don't care about a anymore. Feel free to have your way with a.""

std::move(some_lvalue) casts an lvalue to an rvalue, thus enabling a subsequent move.

Xvalues
Note that even though std::move(a) is an rvalue, its evaluation does not create a temporary object. This conundrum forced the committee to introduce a third value category. Something that can be bound to an rvalue reference, even though it is not an rvalue in the traditional sense, is called an xvalue (eXpiring value). The traditional rvalues were renamed to prvalues (Pure rvalues).
Both prvalues and xvalues are rvalues. Xvalues and lvalues are both glvalues (Generalized lvalues). The relationships are easier to grasp with a diagram:
        expressions
          /     \
         /       \
        /         \
    glvalues   rvalues
      /  \       /  \
     /    \     /    \
    /      \   /      \
lvalues   xvalues   prvalues

Note that only xvalues are really new; the rest is just due to renaming and grouping.

C++98 rvalues are known as prvalues in C++11. Mentally replace all occurrences of ""rvalue"" in the preceding paragraphs with ""prvalue"".

Moving out of functions
So far, we have seen movement into local variables, and into function parameters. But moving is also possible in the opposite direction. If a function returns by value, some object at call site (probably a local variable or a temporary, but could be any kind of object) is initialized with the expression after the return statement as an argument to the move constructor:
unique_ptr<Shape> make_triangle()
{
    return unique_ptr<Shape>(new Triangle);
}          \-----------------------------/
                  |
                  | temporary is moved into c
                  |
                  v
unique_ptr<Shape> c(make_triangle());

Perhaps surprisingly, automatic objects (local variables that are not declared as static) can also be implicitly moved out of functions:
unique_ptr<Shape> make_square()
{
    unique_ptr<Shape> result(new Square);
    return result;   // note the missing std::move
}

How come the move constructor accepts the lvalue result as an argument? The scope of result is about to end, and it will be destroyed during stack unwinding. Nobody could possibly complain afterwards that result had changed somehow; when control flow is back at the caller, result does not exist anymore! For that reason, C++11 has a special rule that allows returning automatic objects from functions without having to write std::move. In fact, you should never use std::move to move automatic objects out of functions, as this inhibits the ""named return value optimization"" (NRVO).

Never use std::move to move automatic objects out of functions.

Note that in both factory functions, the return type is a value, not an rvalue reference. Rvalue references are still references, and as always, you should never return a reference to an automatic object; the caller would end up with a dangling reference if you tricked the compiler into accepting your code, like this:
unique_ptr<Shape>&& flawed_attempt()   // DO NOT DO THIS!
{
    unique_ptr<Shape> very_bad_idea(new Square);
    return std::move(very_bad_idea);   // WRONG!
}


Never return automatic objects by rvalue reference. Moving is exclusively performed by the move constructor, not by std::move, and not by merely binding an rvalue to an rvalue reference.

Moving into members
Sooner or later, you are going to write code like this:
class Foo
{
    unique_ptr<Shape> member;

public:

    Foo(unique_ptr<Shape>&& parameter)
    : member(parameter)   // error
    {}
};

Basically, the compiler will complain that parameter is an lvalue. If you look at its type, you see an rvalue reference, but an rvalue reference simply means ""a reference that is bound to an rvalue""; it does not mean that the reference itself is an rvalue! Indeed, parameter is just an ordinary variable with a name. You can use parameter as often as you like inside the body of the constructor, and it always denotes the same object. Implicitly moving from it would be dangerous, hence the language forbids it.

A named rvalue reference is an lvalue, just like any other variable.

The solution is to manually enable the move:
class Foo
{
    unique_ptr<Shape> member;

public:

    Foo(unique_ptr<Shape>&& parameter)
    : member(std::move(parameter))   // note the std::move
    {}
};

You could argue that parameter is not used anymore after the initialization of member. Why is there no special rule to silently insert std::move just as with return values? Probably because it would be too much burden on the compiler implementors. For example, what if the constructor body was in another translation unit? By contrast, the return value rule simply has to check the symbol tables to determine whether or not the identifier after the return keyword denotes an automatic object.
You can also pass parameter by value. For move-only types like unique_ptr, it seems there is no established idiom yet. Personally, I prefer pass by value, as it causes less clutter in the interface.
Special member functions
C++98 implicitly declares three special member functions on demand, that is, when they are needed somewhere: the copy constructor, the copy assignment operator and the destructor.
X::X(const X&);              // copy constructor
X& X::operator=(const X&);   // copy assignment operator
X::~X();                     // destructor

Rvalue references went through several versions. Since version 3.0, C++11 declares two additional special member functions on demand: the move constructor and the move assignment operator. Note that neither VC10 nor VC11 conform to version 3.0 yet, so you will have to implement them yourself.
X::X(X&&);                   // move constructor
X& X::operator=(X&&);        // move assignment operator

These two new special member functions are only implicitly declared if none of the special member functions are declared manually. Also, if you declare your own move constructor or move assignment operator, neither the copy constructor nor the copy assignment operator will be declared implicitly.
What do these rules mean in practice?

If you write a class without unmanaged resources, there is no need to declare any of the five special member functions yourself, and you will get correct copy semantics and move semantics for free. Otherwise, you will have to implement the special member functions yourself. Of course, if your class does not benefit from move semantics, there is no need to implement the special move operations.

Note that the copy assignment operator and the move assignment operator can be fused into a single, unified assignment operator, taking its argument by value:
X& X::operator=(X source)    // unified assignment operator
{
    swap(source);            // see my first answer for an explanation
    return *this;
}

This way, the number of special member functions to implement drops from five to four. There is a tradeoff between exception-safety and efficiency here, but I am not an expert on this issue.
Forwarding references (previously known as Universal references)
Consider the following function template:
template<typename T>
void foo(T&&);

You might expect T&& to only bind to rvalues, because at first glance, it looks like an rvalue reference. As it turns out though, T&& also binds to lvalues:
foo(make_triangle());   // T is unique_ptr<Shape>, T&& is unique_ptr<Shape>&&
unique_ptr<Shape> a(new Triangle);
foo(a);                 // T is unique_ptr<Shape>&, T&& is unique_ptr<Shape>&

If the argument is an rvalue of type X, T is deduced to be X, hence T&& means X&&. This is what anyone would expect.
But if the argument is an lvalue of type X, due to a special rule, T is deduced to be X&, hence T&& would mean something like X& &&. But since C++ still has no notion of references to references, the type X& && is collapsed into X&. This may sound confusing and useless at first, but reference collapsing is essential for perfect forwarding (which will not be discussed here).

T&& is not an rvalue reference, but a forwarding reference. It also binds to lvalues, in which case T and T&& are both lvalue references.

If you want to constrain a function template to rvalues, you can combine SFINAE with type traits:
#include <type_traits>

template<typename T>
typename std::enable_if<std::is_rvalue_reference<T&&>::value, void>::type
foo(T&&);

Implementation of move
Now that you understand reference collapsing, here is how std::move is implemented:
template<typename T>
typename std::remove_reference<T>::type&&
move(T&& t)
{
    return static_cast<typename std::remove_reference<T>::type&&>(t);
}

As you can see, move accepts any kind of parameter thanks to the forwarding reference T&&, and it returns an rvalue reference. The std::remove_reference<T>::type meta-function call is necessary because otherwise, for lvalues of type X, the return type would be X& &&, which would collapse into X&. Since t is always an lvalue (remember that a named rvalue reference is an lvalue), but we want to bind t to an rvalue reference, we have to explicitly cast t to the correct return type.
The call of a function that returns an rvalue reference is itself an xvalue. Now you know where xvalues come from ;)

The call of a function that returns an rvalue reference, such as std::move, is an xvalue.

Note that returning by rvalue reference is fine in this example, because t does not denote an automatic object, but instead an object that was passed in by the caller.

MyModel.Context.tt

const string inputFile = @""MyModel.edmx""; // old value (remove)
const string inputFile = @""..\MyOtherProjectName\MyModel.edmx""; // new value

In your other project, expand the EDMX file and right-click on MyModel.tt, select Delete.

2485177,33213.0,2010-03-20 23:17:02+00:00,2484980,167,"The problem with volatile in a multithreaded context is that it doesn't provide all the guarantees we need. It does have a few properties we need, but not all of them, so we can't rely on volatile alone.
However, the primitives we'd have to use for the remaining properties also provide the ones that volatile does, so it is effectively unnecessary.
For thread-safe accesses to shared data, we need a guarantee that:

the read/write actually happens (that the compiler won't just store the value in a register instead and defer updating main memory until much later)
that no reordering takes place. Assume that we use a volatile variable as a flag to indicate whether or not some data is ready to be read. In our code, we simply set the flag after preparing the data, so all looks fine. But what if the instructions are reordered so the flag is set first?

volatile does guarantee the first point. It also guarantees that no reordering occurs between different volatile reads/writes. All volatile memory accesses will occur in the order in which they're specified. That is all we need for what volatile is intended for: manipulating I/O registers or memory-mapped hardware, but it doesn't help us in multithreaded code where the volatile object is often only used to synchronize access to non-volatile data. Those accesses can still be reordered relative to the volatile ones.
The solution to preventing reordering is to use a memory barrier, which indicates both to the compiler and the CPU that no memory access may be reordered across this point. Placing such barriers around our volatile variable access ensures that even non-volatile accesses won't be reordered across the volatile one, allowing us to write thread-safe code.
However, memory barriers also ensure that all pending reads/writes are executed when the barrier is reached, so it effectively gives us everything we need by itself, making volatile unnecessary. We can just remove the volatile qualifier entirely.
Since C++11, atomic variables (std::atomic<T>) give us all of the relevant guarantees.
",2484980,1385039.0,2010-03-20 22:10:27+00:00,,128,Why is volatile not considered useful in multithreaded C or C++ programming?,"As demonstrated in this answer I recently posted, I seem to be confused about the utility (or lack thereof) of volatile in multi-threaded programming contexts.
My understanding is this: any time a variable may be changed outside the flow of control of a piece of code accessing it, that variable should be declared to be volatile.  Signal handlers, I/O registers, and variables modified by another thread all constitute such situations.
So, if you have a global int foo, and foo is read by one thread and set atomically by another thread (probably using an appropriate machine instruction), the reading thread sees this situation in the same way it sees a variable tweaked by a signal handler or modified by an external hardware condition and thus foo should be declared volatile (or, for multithreaded situations, accessed with memory-fenced load, which is probably a better a solution).
How and where am I wrong?

1022683,90527.0,2009-06-20 22:13:03+00:00,1022560,149,"Some more differences:

Lua has native support for coroutines.
Lua doesn't convert between types for any comparison operators. In JS, only === and !== don't type juggle.
Lua has an exponentiation operator (^); JS doesn't. JS uses different operators, including the ternary conditional operator (?: vs and/or), and, as of 5.3, bitwise operators (&, |, etc. vs. metamethods ). 
JS has increment/decrement, type operators (typeof and instanceof), additional assignment operators and additional comparison operators.
In JS, the equals and not equals operators are of lower precedence than less than et al. In Lua, all comparison operators are the same precedence.
Lua supports tail calls.
Lua supports assignment to a list of variables. While it isn't yet standard in Javascript, Mozilla's JS engine (and Opera's, to an extent) has supported a similar feature since JS 1.7 (available as part of Firefox 2) under the name ""destructuring assignment"". Destructuring in JS is more general, as it can be used in contexts other than assignment, such as function definitions & calls and loop initializers. Destructuring assignment has been a proposed addition to ECMAScript (the language standard behind Javascript) for awhile.
In Lua, you can overload operators.
In Lua, you can manipulate environments with getfenv & setfenv.
In JS, all functions are variadic. In Lua, functions must be explicitly declared as variadic.
Foreach in JS loops over object properties. Foreach in Lua (which use the keyword for) loops over iterators and is more general.
JS has global and function scope. Lua has global and block scope. Control structures (e.g. if, for, while) introduce new blocks.

Due to differences in scoping rules, a closure's referencing of an outer variable (called ""upvalues"" in Lua parlance) may be handled differently in Lua and in Javascript. This is most commonly experienced with closures in for loops, and catches some people by surprise. In Javascript, the body of a for loop doesn't introduce a new scope, so any functions declared in the loop body all reference the same outer variables. In Lua, each iteration of the for loop creates new local variables for each loop variable.
local i='foo'
for i=1,10 do
  -- ""i"" here is not the local ""i"" declared above
  ...
end
print(i) -- prints 'foo'

The above code is equivalent to:
local i='foo'
do
  local _i=1
  while _i<10 do
    local i=_i
    ...
    _i=_i+1
  end
end
print(i)

As a consequence, functions defined in separate iterations have different upvalues for each referenced loop variable. See also Nicolas Bola's answers to Implementation of closures in Lua? and ""What are the correct semantics of a closure over a loop variable?"", and ""The Semantics of the Generic for"".

Integer literals in JS can be in octal.
JS has explicit Unicode support.
In Lua, ~ is used in place of !. (as in, if foo ~= 20 then ... end) (technically syntax, but it's easily overlooked and causes subtle bugs).
In Lua, the not/or/and keywords are used in place of !/||/&& (also syntax but also easily forgotten).
In Lua, any type of value (except nil and NaN) can be used to index a table; in JavaScript, object indexes are converted to strings.

There are obvious differences, like

syntax
problem domain
libraries
types (a bit)

but which are the more subtle ones? Is there anything a JavaScript coder would take for granted that works in Lua just slightly different? Are there any pitfalls that may not be obvious to the experienced coder of one language trying the other one?
For example: in Lua, arrays and hashes are not separate (there are only tables) - in JavaScript, they are numerical Arrays and hashed Objects. Well, this is one of the more obvious differences.
But are there differences in variable scope, immutability or something like this?

If evaluation of the Expression completes normally, producing a null value, then an instance V' of class NullPointerException is created and thrown instead of null.

Since NullPointerException extends RuntimeException, it is an unchecked exception. This could explain why there's no compile-time error reported from this construct.

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        throw null;
    }
}

We know that rule for throw is throw ThrowableInstance;, where ThrowableInstance must be an object of type Throwable or a subclass of Throwable.
Simple types, such as int or char, as well as non-Throwable classes, such as String and Object, cannot be used as exceptions. null is a special Java literal which represents a null value.
So why would throw null; compile in this code?

The solution seems to be rather simple, at least this is what I plan to do: use setInterval to periodically clean up the expired sessions. MemoryStore provides all() to get the list, and we can use get() to force reading and thus expire them. Pseudo-code:
function sessionCleanup() {
    sessionStore.all(function(err, sessions) {
        for (var i = 0; i < sessions.length; i++) {

This is technically correct because the UINavigationController API doesn't offer any options for this. However by using the CoreAnimation framework it's possible to add a completion block to the underlying animation:

30441546,697630.0,2015-05-25 15:27:12+00:00,29117570,55,"The Book Building Microservices describes in detail the styles mentioned by @RogerAlsing in his answer.
On page 43 under Orchestration vs Choreography the book says:

As we start to model more and more complex logic, we have to deal with
  the problem of managing business processes that stretch across the
  boundary of individual services. And with microservices, weâll hit
  this limit sooner than usual. [...] When it comes to actually
  implementing this flow, there are two styles of architecture we could
  follow. With orchestration, we rely on a central brain to guide and
  drive the process, much like the conductor in an orchestra. With
  choreography, we inform each part of the system of its job, and let it
  work out the details, like dancers all findâ ing their way and
  reacting to others around them in a ballet.

The book then proceeds to explain the two styles. The orchestration style corresponds more to the SOA idea of orchestration/task services, whereas the choreography style corresponds to the dump pipes and smart endpoints mentioned in Martin Fowler's article.
Orchestration Style
Under this style, the book above mentions:

Letâs think about what an orchestration solution would look like for
  this flow. Here, probably the simplest thing to do would be to have
  our customer service act as the central brain. On creation, it talks
  to the loyalty points bank, email service, and postal service [...],
  through a series of request/response calls. The
  customer service itself can then track where a customer is in this
  process. It can check to see if the customerâs account has been set
  up, or the email sent, or the post delivered. We get to take the
  flowchart [...] and model it directly into code. We could even use
  tooling that implements this for us, perhaps using an appropriate
  rules engine. Commercial tools exist for this very purpose in the form
  of business process modeling software. Assuming we use synchronous
  request/response, we could even know if each stage has worked [...]
  The downside to this orchestration approach is that the customer
  service can become too much of a central governing authority. It can
  become the hub in the middle of a web, and a central point where logic
  starts to live. I have seen this approach result in a small number of
  smart âgodâ services telling anemic CRUD-based services what to do.

I suppose that when the author mentions tooling he's referring to something like BPM (e.g. Activity).
Choreography Style
Under choreography style the author says:

With a choreographed approach, we could instead just have the customer
  service emit an event in an asynchronous manner, saying Customer
  created. The email service, postal service, and loyalty points bank
  then just subscribe to these events and react accordingly [...] 
  This approach is significantly more decoupled. If some
  other service needed to reach to the creation of a customer, it just
  needs to subscribe to the events and do its job when needed. The
  downside is that the explicit view of the business process we see in
  [the workflow] is now only implicitly reflected in our system [...]
  This means additional work is needed to ensure that you can monitor
  and track that the right things have happened. For example, would you
  know if the loyalty points bank had a bug and for some reason didnât
  set up the correct account? One approach I like for dealing with this
  is to build a monitoring system that explicitly matches the view of
  the business process in [the workflow], but then tracks what each of
  the services does as independent entities, letting you see odd
  exceptions mapped onto the more explicit process flow. The [flowchart]
  [...] isnât the driving force, but just one lens through
  which we can see how the system is behaving. In general, I have found
  that systems that tend more toward the choreographed approach are more
  loosely coupled, and are more flexible and amenable to change. You do
  need to do extra work to monitor and track the processes across system
  boundaries, however. I have found most heavily orchestrated
  implementations to be extremely brittle, with a higher cost of change.
  With that in mind, I strongly prefer aiming for a choreographed
  system, where each service is smart enough to underâ stand its role in
  the whole dance.

Now, after this comes the fun. The Microservices book does not assume microservices are going to be implemented with REST. As a matter of fact in the next section in the book they proceed to consider RPC and SOA-based solutions and finally REST, which is what they recommend at the end. Important point here is that Microservices does not imply REST.
So, What About HATEOAS?
Now, if we want to follow the RESTful approach we cannot ignore HATEOAS or Roy Fielding will be very much pleased to say in his blog that our solution is not truly REST. See his blog post on REST API Must be Hypertext Driven:

I am getting frustrated by the number of people calling any HTTP-based
  interface a REST API. What needs to be done to make the REST
  architectural style clear on the notion that hypertext is a
  constraint? In other words, if the engine of application state (and
  hence the API) is not being driven by hypertext, then it cannot be
  RESTful and cannot be a REST API. Period. Is there some broken manual
  somewhere that needs to be fixed?

So, as you can see, Fielding thinks that without HATEOAS you are not truly building RESTful applications. For fielding HATEOAS is the way to go when it comes to orchestrate services. I am just learning all this, but to me HATEOAS does not clearly define who or what is the driving force behind actually following the links. In a UI that could be the user, but in computer-to-computer interactions, I suppose that needs to be done by a higher level service.
According to HATEOAS, the only link the API consumer truly needs to know is the one that initiates the communication with the server (e.g. POST /order). From this point on, REST is going to conduct the flow, because in the response of this endpoint, the resource returned will contain the links to next possible states. The API consumer then decides what link to follow and move the application to the next state.
Despite how cool that sounds, the client still needs to know if the link must be POSTed, PUTed, GETed, PATCHed, etc. And the client still needs to decide what payload to pass. The client still needs to be aware of what to do if that fails (retry, compensate, cancel, etc.).
I am fairly new to all this, but for me, from HATEOAs perspective, this client, or API consumer is a high order service. If we think it from the perspective of a human, you can imagine an end user in a web page, deciding what links to follow, but still the programmer of the web page had to decide what method to use to invoke the links, and what payload to pass. So, to my point, in a computer-to-computer interaction, the computer takes the role of the end user. Once more this is what we call an orchestrations service.
I suppose we can use HATEOAS with either orchestration or choreography. 
In Fowler's article he also mentions special care you must have with endpoint versioning if you do so. In HATEOAS approach, if you do a version upgrade, how easily can that be propagated?
The API Gateway Pattern
In an approach more resembling SOA principles than REST ones, Chris Richardson proposed what he called API Gateway Pattern.

In a monolithic architecture, clients of the application, such as web
  browsers and native applications, make HTTP requests via a load
  balancer to one of N identical instances of the application. But in a
  microservice architecture, the monolith has been replaced by a
  collection of services. Consequently, a key question we need to answer
  is what do the clients interact with?
An application client, such as a native mobile application, could make
  RESTful HTTP requests to the individual services [...] On the surface
  this might seem attractive. However, there is likely to be a
  significant mismatch in granularity between the APIs of the individual
  services and data required by the clients. For example, displaying one
  web page could potentially require calls to large numbers of services.
  Amazon.com, for example,
  describes how some
  pages require calls to 100+ services. Making that many requests, even
  over a high-speed internet connection, let alone a lower-bandwidth,
  higher-latency mobile network, would be very inefficient and result in
  a poor user experience.
A much better approach is for clients to make a small number of
  requests per-page, perhaps as few as one, over the Internet to a
  front-end server known as an API gateway.
The API gateway sits between the applicationâs clients and the
  microservices. It provides APIs that are tailored to the client. The
  API gateway provides a coarse-grained API to mobile clients and a
  finer-grained API to desktop clients that use a high-performance
  network. In this example, the desktop clients makes multiple requests
  to retrieve information about a product, where as a mobile client
  makes a single request.
The API gateway handles incoming requests by making requests to some
  number of microservices over the high-performance LAN. Netflix, for
  example,
  describes
  how each request fans out to on average six backend services. In this
  example, fine-grained requests from a desktop client are simply
  proxied to the corresponding service, whereas each coarse-grained
  request from a mobile client is handled by aggregating the results of
  calling multiple services.
Not only does the API gateway optimize communication between clients
  and the application, but it also encapsulates the details of the
  microservices. This enables the microservices to evolve without
  impacting the clients. For examples, two microservices might be
  merged. Another microservice might be partitioned into two or more
  services. Only the API gateway needs to be updated to reflect these
  changes. The clients are unaffected.
Now that we have looked at how the API gateway mediates between the
  application and its clients, letâs now look at how to implement
  communication between microservices.

This sounds pretty similar to the orchestration style mentioned above, just with a slightly different intent, in this case it seems to be all about performance and simplification of interactions.

If a microservice only knows about it's own domain, but there is a flow of data that requires that multiple services interact in some manner, whats the way to go about it?
Lets say we have something like this:

Invoicing
Shipment

And for the sake of the argument, lets say that once an an order have been shipped, the invoice should be created. 
Somewhere, someone presses a button in a GUI, ""Im done, lets do this!""
In a classic monloith service architecture, I'd say that there is either an ESB handling this, or the Shipment service has knowledge of the invoice service and just calls that.
But what is the way people deal with this in this brave new world of microservices?
I do get that this could be considered highly oppinion based. but there is a concrete side to it, as microservices are not supposed to do the above.
So there has to be a ""what should it by definition do instead"", which is not oppinion based.
Shoot.

Not only as the S language designed precisely for this purpose (see the books by John Chambers), but the rather rich support of domain-specific packages at CRAN is second to none: over 2000 packages with proper quality control, often authored by experts in the field.
The ACM sees it the same way when it gave the ACM Software Systems Award to John Chambers in 1998 with the following citation

John M. Chambers

  altered how people analyze, visualize,

For reference, other winners of this award were TeX, Smalltalk, Postscript, RPC, 'the web', Mosaic, Tcl/Tk, Java, Make, ... Not a bad company to be in.
Now, if you 'only' want to collect and summarize some data just about any procedural or functional language will do.  But if you want something that was designed for programming with data then R as the main S implementation it is.

Now git wonât do any line ending normalization. If you want files you check in to be normalized, do this: Set text=auto in your .gitattributes for all files:
* text=auto

And set core.eol to lf:
git config --global core.eol lf

Now you can also switch single repos to crlf (in the working directory!) by running
git config core.eol crlf

After you have done the configuration, you might want git to normalize all the files in the repo. To do this, go to to the root of your repo and run these commands:
git rm --cached -rf .
git diff --cached --name-only -z | xargs -n 50 -0 git add -f

If you now want git to also normalize the files in your working directory, run these commands:

catch(Exception exc) { /* won't catch RuntimeException */

but
catch(Throwable exc) { /* will catch RuntimeException */

I know RuntimeException is special in that it's unchecked. But to my understanding that applies just to whether exceptions have to be declared, not whether they are caught. And even then, I don't know why this logic would break on catching Throwable.
This is pretty relevant to me since I have a situation where RuntimeExceptions can be thrown in a terminal operation.  I'm not sure the name for this pattern, but something like, my class EmailRoller takes an array of Callbacks.  The code looks like this:
for(Callback cb : callbacks) {
    try {
        cb.call(item);
    }
    catch(Exception exc) {
        logger.error(""Error in callback: "", exc);
   }
}

So this is a case where something like an OOME needs to fly through, because if one of these callbacks consumes all machine memory, that sure as heck is going to affect the running of the other ones. But a NullPointerException? Or an IndexOutOfBoundsException?  Those will affect the callback but won't prevent the others from running.
Also, this is a bit of an enterprise design. Different programmers or teams can add callbacks to process the item, but they should be isolated from each other.  This means, as the programmer responsible for insulating these callbacks from each other, I shouldn't rely on them to make sure errors don't slip through. Catching Exception should be about the right line, but it isn't because RuntimeException slips through.  So my more general question is:  what's a good pattern here?  Just catch(Exception | RuntimeException exc), which I believe is a syntax error because of the inheritance?

The annoying thing is that renaming all my id's would be a lot of work, not to mention the loss in readability.

I believe attr_readonly does what I want on an attribute level, but I don't want to have to manually specify fields... I would rather have more of a white-list approach.
Also, I know there is a :read_only option for associations, but I don't want to limit the ""readonlyness"" of the object to if it was fetched via an association or not.
Finally, I want to be able to still destroy a record so stuff like :dependent => :destroy works in the associations.
So, to summarize: 1) allow the creation of records, 2) allow the deletion of records, and  3) prevent changing records that have been persisted.

Summary: In imperative languages you tell the computer how to change bits, bytes and words in it's memory and in what order. In functional ones, we tell the computer what things, actions etc. are. For example, we say that the factorial of 0 is 1, and the factorial of every other natural number is the product of that number and the factorial of its predecessor. We don't say: To compute the factorial of n, reserve a memory region and store 1 there, then multiply the number in that memory region with the numbers 2 to n and store the result at the same place, and at the end, the memory region will contain the factorial.

I vaguely remember a tweet I saw a while ago that suggested there was a css rule available that would remove any styles previously set in the stylesheet for a particular element.
A good use example might be in a mobile-first RWD site where much of the styling used for a particular element in the small-screen views needs 'resetting' or removing for the same element in the desktop view.
A css rule that could achieve something like:
.element {
  all: none;
}

Eaxmple usage:
/* mobile first */
.element {
   margin: 0 10;
   transform: translate3d(0, 0, 0);
   z-index: 50;
   display: block;
   etc..
   etc..
}

@media only screen and (min-width: 980px) {
  .element {
    all: none;
  }
}

So we could quickly remove or re-set styling without having to declare every property.
Make sense?

4341919,134633.0,2010-12-03 02:24:01+00:00,4341570,60,"To understand why variably-sized arrays are more complicated to implement, you need to know a little about how automatic storage duration (""local"") variables are usually implemented.
Local variables tend to be stored on the runtime stack.  The stack is basically a large array of memory, which is sequentially allocated to local variables and with a single index pointing to the current ""high water mark"".  This index is the stack pointer.
When a function is entered, the stack pointer is moved in one direction to allocate memory on the stack for local variables; when the function exits, the stack pointer is moved back in the other direction, to deallocate them.
This means that the actual location of local variables in memory is defined only with reference to the value of the stack pointer at function entry1.  The code in a function must access local variables via an offset from the stack pointer.  The exact offsets to be used depend upon the size of the local variables.
Now, when all the local variables have a size that is fixed at compile-time, these offsets from the stack pointer are also fixed - so they can be coded directly into the instructions that the compiler emits.  For example, in this function:
void foo(void)
{
    int a;
    char b[10];
    int c;

a might be accessed as STACK_POINTER + 0, b might be accessed as STACK_POINTER + 4, and c might be accessed as STACK_POINTER + 14.
However, when you introduce a variably-sized array, these offsets can no longer be computed at compile-time; some of them will vary depending upon the size that the array has on this invocation of the function.  This makes things significantly more complicated for compiler writers, because they must now write code that accesses STACK_POINTER + N - and since N itself varies, it must also be stored somewhere.  Often this means doing two accesses - one to STACK_POINTER + <constant> to load N, then another to load or store the actual local variable of interest.

1. In fact, ""the value of the stack pointer at function entry"" is such a useful value to have around, that it has a name of its own - the frame pointer - and many CPUs provide a separate register dedicated to storing the frame pointer.  In practice, it is usually the frame pointer from which the location of local variables is calculated, rather than the stack pointer itself.
",4341570,419391.0,2010-12-03 01:01:10+00:00,,29,Why does a C/C++ compiler need know the size of an array at compile time?,"I know C standards preceding C99 (as well as C++) says that the size of an array on stack must be known at compile time. But why is that? The array on stack is allocated at run-time. So why does the size matter in compile time? Hope someone explain to me what a compiler will do with size at compile time. Thanks.  
The example of such an array is:
void func()
{
    /*Here ""array"" is a local variable on stack, its space is allocated
     *at run-time. Why does the compiler need know its size at compile-time?
     */
   int array[10];

The relevant documentation for this:

If a document does not have a value for the indexed field in a unique index, the index will store a null value for this document. Because of the unique constraint, MongoDB will only permit one document that lacks the indexed field. If there is more than one document without a value for the indexed field or is missing the indexed field, the index build will fail with a duplicate key error.
You can combine the unique constraint with the sparse index to filter these null values from the unique index and avoid the error.

Sparse indexes only contain entries for documents that have the indexed field, even if the index field contains a null value.

I will try to show this by and example. Given that we have the below modules and classes. SomeClassB1 is dependent on SomeClassA1. Notice the provideSomeClassB1 method in ModuleB which shows this dependency.
@Module
public class ModuleA {
    @Provides
    public SomeClassA1 provideSomeClassA1() {
        return new SomeClassA1();

@Module
public class ModuleB {

        return new SomeClassB1(someClassA1);
    }
}

    public SomeClassA1() {}
}

    public SomeClassB1(SomeClassA1 someClassA1) {
        this.someClassA1 = someClassA1;
    }
}

Note the following points in the Component Dependency example below:

SomeClassB1 is dependent on SomeClassA1. ComponentB has to explicitly define the dependency.
ComponentA doesn't need to declare ModuleB. This keeps the two components independent.

public class ComponentDependency {
    @Component(modules = ModuleA.class)
    public interface ComponentA {
        SomeClassA1 someClassA1();
    }

    @Component(modules = ModuleB.class, dependencies = ComponentA.class)
    public interface ComponentB {
        SomeClassB1 someClassB1();
    }

        ComponentB componentB = DaggerComponentDependency_ComponentB.builder()

                .componentA(componentA)
                .build();
    }
}

Note the following points in the SubComponent example:

SomeClassB1 is dependent on SomeClassA1. ComponentB need not explicitly define the dependency.
ComponentA has to declare ModuleB. This makes the two components coupled.

public class SubComponent {
    @Component(modules = {ModuleA.class, ModuleB.class})

ignoring pronouns is done via a stoplist.
preserving proper nouns? You mean, detecting named entities, like Hoover Dam and saying ""it's one word"" or compound nouns, like programming language? I'll give you a hint: that's tough one, but there exist libraries for both. Look for NER (Named entitiy recognition) and lexical chunking. OpenNLP is a Java-Toolkit that does both.
ignoring hyphenation? You mean, like at line breaks? Use regular expressions and verify the resulting word via dictionary lookup.
handling plurals/stemming: you can look into the Snowball stemmer. It does the trick nicely.
""grouping"" adjectives with their nouns is generally a task of shallow parsing. But if you are looking specifically for qualitative adjectives (good, bad, shitty, amazing...) you may be interested in sentiment analysis. LingPipe does this, and a lot more.

I'm sorry, I know you said you wanted to KISS, but unfortunately, your demands aren't that easy to meet. Nevertheless, there exist tools for all of this, and you should be able to just tie them together and not have to perform any task yourself, if you don't want to. If you want to perform a task yourself, I suggest you look at stemming, it's the easiest of all.
If you go with Java, combine Lucene with the OpenNLP toolkit. You will get very good results, as Lucene already has a stemmer built in and a lot of tutorial. The OpenNLP toolkit on the other hand is poorly documented, but you won't need too much out of it. You might also be interested in NLTK, written in Python.
I would say you drop your last requirement, as it involves shallow parsing and will definetly not impove your results.

How can I check whether a variable is defined in JavaScript?
Is there a standard function to check for null, undefined, or blank variables in JavaScript? 

I have a script that occurs in two parts.
The first part sets up a var:
var pagetype = ""textpage"";

The 2nd part is a simple if statement:
if(pagetype == ""textpage"") {
//do something
};

Now the 2nd part, the if statement, appears on all pages of my site. But the first part, where the var is declared, only appears on some of my pages.
On the pages without the var I naturally get this error:
Uncaught ReferenceError: pagetype is not defined

So my question is: is there a way with JavaScript or JQ to detect if a var exists at all (not just if it has data assigned to it)?
I am imagining I would just use another if statment, eg:
if (""a var called pagetypes exists"")....

7936350,393050.0,2011-10-29 01:17:04+00:00,7897630,56,"UPDATE: EF6 includes dramatic performance improvements for Enumerable.Contains.
You are right that most of the time is spent processing the translation of the query. EF's provider model doesn't currently include an expression that represents an IN clause, therefore ADO.NET providers can't support IN natively. Instead, the implementation of Enumerable.Contains translates it to a tree of OR expressions, i.e. for something that in C# looks like like this:
new []{1, 2, 3, 4}.Contains(i)

... we will generate a DbExpression tree that could be represented like this:
((1 = @i) OR (2 = @i)) OR ((3 = @i) OR (4 = @i))

(The expression trees have to be balanced because if we had all the ORs over a single long spine there would be more chances that the expression visitor would hit a stack overflow (yes, we actually did hit that in our testing)) 
We later send a tree like this to the ADO.NET provider, which can have the ability to recognize this pattern and reduce it to the IN clause during SQL generation. 
When we added support for Enumerable.Contains in EF4, we thought it was desirable to do it without having to introduce support for IN expressions in the provider model, and honestly, 10,000 is much more than the number of elements we anticipated customers would pass to Enumerable.Contains. That said, I understand that this is an annoyance and that the manipulation of expressions trees makes things too expensive in your particular scenario.
I discussed this with one of our developers and we believe that in the future we could change the implementation by adding first-class support for IN. I will make sure this is added to our backlog, but I cannot promise when it will make it given there are many other improvements we would like to make. 
To the workarounds already suggested in the thread I would add the following:
Consider creating a method that balances the number of database roundtrips with the number of elements you pass to Contains. For instance, in my own testing I observed that computing and executing against a local instance of SQL Server the query with 100 elements takes 1/60 of a second. If you can write your query in such a way that executing 100 queries with 100 different sets of ids would give you equivalent result to the query with 10,000 elements, then you can get the results in aproximately 1.67 seconds instead of 18 seconds. 
Different chunk sizes should work better depending on the query and the latency of the database connection. For certain queries, i.e. if the sequence passed has duplicates or if Enumerable.Contains is used in a nested condition you may obtain duplicate elements in the results. 
Here is a code snippet (sorry if the code used to slice the input into chunks looks a little too complex. There are simpler ways to achieve the same thing, but I was trying to come up with a pattern that preserves streaming for the sequence and I couldn't find anything like it in LINQ, so I probably overdid that part :) ):
Usage:
var list = context.GetMainItems(ids).ToList();

Method for context or repository:
public partial class ContainsTestEntities
{
    public IEnumerable<Main> GetMainItems(IEnumerable<int> ids, int chunkSize = 100)
    {
        foreach (var chunk in ids.Chunk(chunkSize))
        {
            var q = this.MainItems.Where(a => chunk.Contains(a.Id));
            foreach (var item in q)
            {
                yield return item;
            }
        }
    }
}

Extension methods for slicing enumerable sequences:
public static class EnumerableSlicing
{

    private class Status
    {
        public bool EndOfSequence;
    }

    private static IEnumerable<T> TakeOnEnumerator<T>(IEnumerator<T> enumerator, int count, 
        Status status)
    {
        while (--count > 0 && (enumerator.MoveNext() || !(status.EndOfSequence = true)))
        {
            yield return enumerator.Current;
        }
    }

    public static IEnumerable<IEnumerable<T>> Chunk<T>(this IEnumerable<T> items, int chunkSize)
    {
        if (chunkSize < 1)
        {
            throw new ArgumentException(""Chunks should not be smaller than 1 element"");
        }
        var status = new Status { EndOfSequence = false };
        using (var enumerator = items.GetEnumerator())
        {
            while (!status.EndOfSequence)
            {
                yield return TakeOnEnumerator(enumerator, chunkSize, status);
            }
        }
    }
}

UPDATE 2: I've created a suggestion to fix this problem. To vote for it, go here.
Consider a SQL database with one very simple table.
CREATE TABLE Main (Id INT PRIMARY KEY)

I populate the table with 10,000 records.
WITH Numbers AS
(
  SELECT 1 AS Id
  UNION ALL
  SELECT Id + 1 AS Id FROM Numbers WHERE Id <= 10000
)
INSERT Main (Id)
SELECT Id FROM Numbers
OPTION (MAXRECURSION 0)

I build an EF model for the table and run the following query in LINQPad (I am using ""C# Statements"" mode so LINQPad doesn't create a dump automatically).
var rows = 
  Main
  .ToArray();

Execution time is ~0.07 seconds. Now I add the Contains operator and re-run the query.
var ids = Main.Select(a => a.Id).ToArray();
var rows = 
  Main
  .Where (a => ids.Contains(a.Id))
  .ToArray();

Execution time for this case is 20.14 seconds (288 times slower)!
At first I suspected that the T-SQL emitted for the query was taking longer to execute, so I tried cutting and pasting it from LINQPad's SQL pane into SQL Server Management Studio.
SET NOCOUNT ON
SET STATISTICS TIME ON
SELECT 
[Extent1].[Id] AS [Id]
FROM [dbo].[Primary] AS [Extent1]
WHERE [Extent1].[Id] IN (1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,...

And the result was
SQL Server Execution Times:
  CPU time = 0 ms,  elapsed time = 88 ms.

Next I suspected LINQPad was causing the problem, but performance is the same whether I run it in LINQPad or in a console application.
So, it appears that the problem is somewhere within Entity Framework.
Am I doing something wrong here? This is a time-critical part of my code, so is there something I can do to speed up performance?
I am using Entity Framework 4.1 and Sql Server 2008 R2.
UPDATE 1:
In the discussion below there were some questions about whether the delay occurred while EF was building the initial query or while it was parsing the data it received back. To test this I ran the following code,
var ids = Main.Select(a => a.Id).ToArray();
var rows = 
  (ObjectQuery<MainRow>)
  Main
  .Where (a => ids.Contains(a.Id));
var sql = rows.ToTraceString();

which forces EF to generate the query without executing it against the database. The result was that this code required ~20 secords to run, so it appears that almost all of the time is taken in building the initial query.
CompiledQuery to the rescue then? Not so fast ... CompiledQuery requires the parameters passed into the query to be fundamental types (int, string, float, and so on). It won't accept arrays or IEnumerable, so I can't use it for a list of Ids.

1) Calling with an array of the parameter type, in which case the params keyword has no effect and the array is passed directly to the method:
object[] array = new[] { ""1"", ""2"" };

// Foo receives the 'array' argument directly.
Foo( array );

2) Or, calling with an extended list of arguments, in which case the compiler will automatically wrap the list of arguments in a temporary array and pass that to the method:
// Foo receives a temporary array containing the list of arguments.
Foo( ""1"", ""2"" );

// This is equivalent to:
object[] temp = new[] { ""1"", ""2"" );
Foo( temp );


In order to pass in an object array to a method with a ""params object[]"" parameter, you can either:
1) Create a wrapper array manually and pass that directly to the method, as mentioned by lassevk:
Foo( new object[] { array } );  // Equivalent to calling convention 1.

2) Or, cast the argument to object, as mentioned by Adam, in which case the compiler will create the wrapper array for you:
Foo( (object)array );  // Equivalent to calling convention 2.


However, if the goal of the method is to process multiple object arrays, it may be easier to declare it with an explicit ""params object[][]"" parameter. This would allow you to pass multiple arrays as arguments:
void Foo( params object[][] arrays ) {
  foreach( object[] array in arrays ) {
    // process array
  }
}

...
Foo( new[] { ""1"", ""2"" }, new[] { ""3"", ""4"" } );

// Equivalent to:
object[][] arrays = new[] {
  new[] { ""1"", ""2"" },
  new[] { ""3"", ""4"" }
};
Foo( arrays );


Edit: Raymond Chen describes this behavior and how it relates to the C# specification in a new post.

3956038,18936.0,2010-10-18 01:10:20+00:00,3955790,77,"Circular imports are not inherently a bad thing. It's natural for the team code to rely on user whilst the user does something with team.
The worse practice here is from module import member. The team module is trying to get the user class at import-time, and the user module is trying to get the team class. But the team class doesn't exist yet because you're still at the first line of team.py when user.py is run.
Instead, import only modules. This results in clearer namespacing, makes later monkey-patching possible, and solves the import problem. Because you're only importing the module at import-time, you don't care than the class inside it isn't defined yet. By the time you get around to using the class, it will be.
So, test/users.py:
import test.teams

class User:
    def setTeam(self, t):
        if isinstance(t, test.teams.Team):
            self.team = t

from test import teams and then teams.Team is also OK, if you want to write test less. That's still importing a module, not a module member.
Also, if Team and User are relatively simple, put them in the same module. You don't need to follow the Java one-class-per-file idiom. The isinstance testing and set methods also scream unpythonic-Java-wart to me; depending on what you're doing you may very well be better off using a plain, non-type-checked @property.

7034719,807231.0,2011-08-12 01:22:19+00:00,40480,509,"This will give you some insights of how Java really works to the point that in your next discussion about Java passing by reference or passing by value you'll just smile :-)
Step one please erase from your mind that word that starts with 'p' ""_ _ _ _ _ _ _"", especially if you come from other programming languages. Java and 'p' cannot be written in the same book, forum, or even txt.
Step two remember that when you pass an Object into a method you're passing the Object reference and not the Object itself.

Student: Master, does this mean that Java is pass-by-reference?
Master: Grasshopper, No.

Now think of what an Object's reference/variable does/is:

A variable holds the bits that tell the JVM how to get to the referenced Object in memory (Heap).
When passing arguments to a method you ARE NOT passing the reference variable, but a copy of the bits in the reference variable. Something like this: 3bad086a. 3bad086a represents a way to get to the passed object.
So you're just passing 3bad086a that it's the value of the reference.
You're passing the value of the reference and not the reference itself (and not the object).
This value is actually COPIED and given to the method. 

In the following (please don't try to compile/execute this...):
1. Person person;
2. person = new Person(""Tom"");
3. changeName(person);
4.
5. //I didn't use Person person below as an argument to be nice
6. static void changeName(Person anotherReferenceToTheSamePersonObject) {
7.     anotherReferenceToTheSamePersonObject.setName(""Jerry"");
8. }

What happens?

The variable person is created in line #1 and it's null at the beginning.
A new Person Object is created in line #2, stored in memory, and the variable person is given the reference to the Person object. That is, its address. Let's say 3bad086a.
The variable person holding the address of the Object is passed to the function in line #3.
In line #4 you can listen to the sound of silence 
Check the comment on line #5
A method local variable -anotherReferenceToTheSamePersonObject- is created and then comes the magic in line #6:

The variable/reference person is copied bit-by-bit and passed to anotherReferenceToTheSamePersonObject inside the function.
No new instances of Person are created.
Both ""person"" and ""anotherReferenceToTheSamePersonObject"" hold the same value of 3bad086a.
Don't try this but person==anotherReferenceToTheSamePersonObject would be true.
Both variables have IDENTICAL COPIES of the reference and they both refer to the same Person Object, the SAME Object on the Heap and NOT A COPY.


A picture is worth a thousand words:

Note that the anotherReferenceToTheSamePersonObject arrows is directed towards the Object and not towards the variable person!
If you didn't get it then just trust me and remember that it's better to say that Java is pass by value. Well, pass by reference value. Oh well, even better is pass-by-copy-of-the-variable-value! ;)
Now feel free to hate me but note that given this there is no difference between passing primitive data types and Objects when talking about method arguments.
You always pass a copy of the bits of the value of the reference!

If it's a primitive data type these bits will contain the value of the primitive data type itself.
If it's an Object the bits will contain the value of the address that tells the JVM how to get to the Object.


Java is pass-by-value because inside a method you can modify the referenced Object as much as you want but no matter how hard you try you'll never be able to modify the passed variable that will keep referencing (not p _ _ _ _ _ _ _) the same Object no matter what!



The changeName function above will never be able to modify the actual content (the bit values) of the passed reference. In other word changeName cannot make Person person refer to another Object.


Of course you can cut it short and just say that  Java is pass-by-value!

As to whether it is technically an uninstall of the old product, or an in-place upgrade seems of little importance.
The key is in the difference between Product Code and Upgrade Code:

Product Code: Since this code uniquely identifies your product, changing the product code after you have already distributed your release is not recommended.
Upgrade Code: The upgrade code, stored in the UpgradeCode property, should remain the same for all versions of a product.

(This text is directly from the InstallShield LE help library.)
It isn't exactly straightforward how to use these codes to deploy products and version updates of the same product.

The help text makes it sound like you should never change the product code. This is not the case. It should probably be written more clearly to say ""Since this code uniquely identifies your product version, changing the product code after you have already distributed a particular release is not recommended."" ... or something like that.
Basically you should change the Product Code when creating a new version to release. Leave the Upgrade Code alone! To change the Product Code, click the {..} button to the right of the code. InstallShield LE will generate a new code.
My standard procedure is to change the versions for my projects, generate a new product code, and build the InstallShield setup project.

Probably because I'm doing something wrong, but it seems I'm jumping through a lot of hoops to do something that I would think should be relatively straight-forward.

The top result in google points to this answer:

open your old MSI with Orca and get its UpgradeCode from Property table
in your InstallShield LE project go to ""General Information"" in solution explorer
make sure that the ""Upgrade Code"" field is set to your old MSI UpgradeCode

Does this mean I have to open my 'old MSI with Orca and get its UpgradeCode' every time I want to deploy a new version?
This sounds a little hackish, and is certainly something I don't want to have to do every time I deploy a new version. Is there a way to automate this? Is this functionality available in more advanced versions of InstallShield (bare in mind I'm on LE - I'll upgrade if necessary)

What's the difference?  Substrings can appear within other words:

The ""are"" at the beginning of ""area""
The ""are"" at the end of ""hare""
The ""are"" in the middle of ""fares""

One way to mitigate this would be to use a regular expression coupled with word boundaries (\b):
function containsWord($str, $word)
{
    return !!preg_match('#\b' . preg_quote($word, '#') . '\b#i', $str);
}

This method doesn't have the same false positives noted above, but it does have some edge cases of its own.  Word boundaries match on non-word characters (\W), which are going to be anything that isn't a-z, A-Z, 0-9, or _.  That means digits and underscores are going to be counted as word characters and scenarios like this will fail:

The ""are"" in ""What _are_ you thinking?""
The ""are"" in ""lol u dunno wut those are4?""

If you want anything more accurate than this, you'll have to start doing English language syntax parsing, and that's a pretty big can of worms (and assumes proper use of syntax, anyway, which isn't always a given).

volatile int* p;

is a pointer to an int that the compiler will treat as volatile.  This means that the compiler will assume that it is possible for the variable that p is pointing at to have changed even if there is nothing in the source code to suggest that this might occur.  For example, if I set p to point to a regular integer, then every time I read or write *p the compiler is aware that the value may have changed unexpectedly.
There is one more use case for a volatile int*: If you declare an int as volatile, then you should not point at it with a regular int*.  For example, this is a bad idea:
volatile int myVolatileInt;
int* ptr = &myVolatileInt; // Bad idea!

The reason for this is that the C compiler no longer remembers that the variable pointed at by ptr is volatile, so it might cache the value of *p in a register incorrectly.  In fact, in C++, the above code is an error.  Instead, you should write
volatile int myVolatileInt;
volatile int* ptr = &myVolatileInt; // Much better!

Now, the compiler remembers that ptr points at a volatile int, so it won't (or shouldn't!) try to optimize accesses through *ptr.
One last detail - the pointer you discussed is a pointer to a volatile int.  You can also do this:
int* volatile ptr;

This says that the pointer itself is volatile, which means that the compiler shouldn't try to cache the pointer in memory or try to optimize the pointer value because the pointer itself might get reassigned by something else (hardware, another thread, etc.)  You can combine these together if you'd like to get this beast:
volatile int* volatile ptr;

This says that both the pointer and the pointee could get changed unexpectedly.  The compiler can't optimize the pointer itself, and it can't optimize what's being pointed at.
Hope this helps!

The curious situation with Numpy scalar-types was bore out of the fact that there is no graceful and consistent way to degrade the 1x1 matrix to scalar types. Even though mathematically they are the same thing, they are handled by very different code.
If you've been doing any amount of scientific code, ultimately you'd want things like max(a) to work on matrices of all sizes, even scalars. Mathematically, this is a perfectly sensible thing to expect. However for programmers this means that whatever presents scalars in Numpy should have the .shape and .ndim attirbute, so at least the ufuncs don't have to do explicit type checking on its input for the 21 possible scalar types in Numpy. 
On the other hand, they should also work with existing Python libraries that does do explicit type-checks on scalar type. This is a dilemma, since a Numpy ndarray have to individually change its type when they've been reduced to a scalar, and there is no way of knowing whether that has occurred without it having do checks on all access. Actually going that route would probably make bit ridiculously slow to work with by scalar type standards.
The Numpy developer's solution is to inherit from both ndarray and Python scalars for its own scalary type, so that all scalars also have .shape, .ndim, .T, etc etc. The 1x1 matrix will still be there, but its use will be discouraged if you know you'll be dealing with a scalar. While this should work fine in theory, occasionally you could still see some places where they missed with the paint roller, and the ugly innards are exposed for all to see:
>>> from numpy import *
>>> a = array(1)
>>> b = int_(1)
>>> a.ndim
0
>>> b.ndim
0
>>> a[...]
array(1)
>>> a[()]
1
>>> b[...]
array(1)
>>> b[()]
1

There's really no reason why a[...] and a[()] should return different things, but it does. There are proposals in place to change this, but looks like they forgot to finish the job for 1x1 arrays.
A potentially bigger, and possibly non-resolvable issue, is the fact that Numpy scalars are immutable. Therefore ""spraying"" a scalar into a ndarray, mathematically the adjoint operation of collapsing an array into a scalar, is a PITA to implement. You can't actually grow a Numpy scalar, it cannot by definition be cast into an ndarray, even though newaxis mysteriously works on it:
>>> b[0,1,2,3] = 1
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File ""<stdin>"", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: 'numpy.int32' object does not support item assignment
>>> b[newaxis]
array([1])

In Matlab, growing the size of a scalar is a perfectly acceptable and brainless operation. In Numpy you have to stick jarring a = array(a) everywhere you think you'd have the possibility of starting with a scalar and ending up with an array. I understand why Numpy has to be this way to play nice with Python, but that doesn't change the fact that many new switchers are deeply confused about this. Some have explicit memory of struggling with this behaviour and eventually persevering, while others who are too far gone are generally left with some deep shapeless mental scar that frequently haunts their most innocent dreams. It's an ugly situation for all.

Declaring a pointer-to-const or reference-of-const never helps any compiler to optimize anything.  (Although see the Update at the bottom of this answer.)
The const declaration only indicates how an identifier will be used within the scope of its declaration; it does not say that the underlying object can not change.
Example:
int foo(const int *p) {
    int x = *p;
    bar(x);
    x = *p;
    return x;
}

The compiler cannot assume that *p is not modified by the call to bar(), because p could be (e.g.) a pointer to a global int and bar() might modify it.
If the compiler knows enough about the caller of foo() and the contents of bar() that it can prove bar() does not modify *p, then it can also perform that proof without the const declaration.
But this is true in general.  Because const only has an effect within the scope of the declaration, the compiler can already see how you are treating the pointer or reference within that scope; it already knows that you are not modifying the underlying object.
So in short, all const does in this context is prevent you from making mistakes.  It does not tell the compiler anything it does not already know, and therefore it is irrelevant for optimization.
What about functions that call foo()?  Like:
int x = 37;
foo(&x);
printf(""%d\n"", x);

Can the compiler prove that this prints 37, since foo() takes a const int *?
No.  Even though foo() takes a pointer-to-const, it might cast the const-ness away and modify the int.  (This is not undefined behavior.)  Here again, the compiler cannot make any assumptions in general; and if it knows enough about foo() to make such an optimization, it will know that even without the const.
The only time const might allow optimizations is cases like this:
const int x = 37;
foo(&x);
printf(""%d\n"", x);

Here, to modify x through any mechanism whatsoever (e.g., by taking a pointer to it and casting away the const) is to invoke Undefined Behavior.  So the compiler is free to assume you do not do that, and it can propagate the constant 37 into the printf().  This sort of optimization is legal for any object you declare const.  (In practice, a local variable to which you never take a reference will not benefit, because the compiler can already see whether you modify it within its scope.)
To answer your ""side note"" question, (a) a const pointer is a pointer; and (b) a const pointer can equal NULL.  You are correct that the internal representation (i.e. an address) is most likely the same.
[update]
As Christoph points out in the comments, my answer is incomplete because it does not mention restrict.
Section 6.7.3.1 (4) of the C99 standard says:

During each execution of B, let L be any lvalue that has &L based on P. If L is used to
  access the value of the object X that it designates, and X is also modified (by any means),
   then the following requirements apply: T shall not be const-qualified. ...

(Here B is a basic block over which P, a restrict-pointer-to-T, is in scope.)
So if a C function foo() is declared like this:
foo(const int * restrict p)

...then the compiler may assume that no modifications to *p occur during the lifetime of p -- i.e., during the execution of foo() -- because otherwise the Behavior would be Undefined.
So in principle, combining restrict with a pointer-to-const could enable both of the optimizations that are dismissed above.  Do any compilers actually implement such an optimization, I wonder?  (GCC 4.5.2, at least, does not.)
Note that restrict only exists in C, not C++ (not even C++0x), except as a compiler-specific extension.

If you compose all three, you can use the one result to map all the way from object space to screen space, making you able to work out what you need to pass on to the next stage of a programmable pipeline from the incoming vertex positions.
In the fixed functionality pipelines of old, you'd apply model and view together, then work out lighting using another result derived from them (with some fixes so that e.g. normals are still unit length even if you've applied some scaling to the object), then apply projection. You can see that reflected in OpenGL, which never separates the model and view matrices â keeping them as a single modelview matrix stack. You therefore also sometimes see that reflected in shaders.

Maybe specifics of brace position should remain purely religious arguments - but it doesn't mean that all layout styles are equal, or that there are no objective factors at all!
The trouble is that the uber-rule for layout, namely: ""be consistent"", sound as it is, is used as a crutch by many to never try to see if their default style can be improved on - and that, furthermore, it doesn't even matter.
A few years ago I was studying Speed Reading techniques, and some of the things I learned about how the eye takes in information in ""fixations"", can most optimally scan pages, and the role of subconsciously picking up context, got me thinking about how this applied to code - and writing code with it in mind especially.
It led me to a style that tended to be columnar in nature, with identifiers logically grouped and aligned where possible (in particular I became strict about having each method argument on its own line). However, rather than long columns of unchanging structure it's actually beneficial to vary the structure in blocks so that you end up with rectangular islands that the eye can take in in a single fixture - even if you don't consciously read every character.
The net result is that, once you get used to it (which typically takes 1-3 days) it becomes pleasing to the eye, easier and faster to comprehend, and is less taxing on the eyes and brain because it's laid out in a way that makes it easier to take in.
Almost without exception, everyone I have asked to try this style (including myself) initially said, ""ugh I hate it!"", but after a day or two said, ""I love it - I'm finding it hard not to go back and rewrite all my old stuff this way!"".
I've been hoping to find the time to do more controlled experiments to collect together enough evidence to write a paper on, but as ever have been too busy with other things. However this seemed like a good opportunity to mention it to people interested in controversial techniques :-)

Best solutions so far:
On Linux/UNIX/OS X/cygwin:

Gnu iconv suggested by Troels Arvin is best used as a filter. It seems to be universally available. Example:
$ iconv -f UTF-8 -t ISO-8859-15 in.txt > out.txt

As pointed out by Ben, there is an online converter using iconv.
Gnu recode (manual) suggested by Cheekysoft will convert one or several files in-place. Example:
$ recode UTF8..ISO-8859-15 in.txt

This one uses shorter aliases:
$ recode utf8..l9 in.txt

Recode also supports surfaces which can be used to convert between different line ending types and encodings:
Convert newlines from LF (Unix) to CR-LF (DOS):
$ recode ../CR-LF in.txt

Base64 encode file:
$ recode ../Base64 in.txt

You can also combine them.
Convert a Base64 encoded UTF8 file with Unix line endings to Base64 encoded Latin 1 file with Dos line endings:
$ recode utf8/Base64..l1/CR-LF/Base64 file.txt


On Windows with Powershell (Jay Bazuzi): 

PS C:\> gc -en utf8 in.txt | Out-File -en ascii out.txt
(No ISO-8859-15 support though; it says that supported charsets are unicode, utf7, utf8, utf32, ascii, bigendianunicode, default, and oem.)

Edit
Do you mean iso-8859-1 support? Using ""String"" does this e.g. for vice versa
gc -en string in.txt | Out-File -en utf8 out.txt

Note: The possible enumeration values are ""Unknown, String, Unicode, Byte, BigEndianUnicode, UTF8, UTF7, Ascii"".

It's not reference vs. value. In order to understand how Java handles memory, you need to get a good grasp of stack/heap.
Crash course on stack/heap before we get to the Java implementation:
Values go on and off the stack in a nice orderly fashion, like a stack of plates at a cafeteria.
Memory in the heap (also known as dynamic memory) is haphazard and disorganized. The JVM just finds space wherever it can, and frees it up as the variables that use it are no longer needed.
Okay. First off, primitives go on the stack. So this code:
int x = 3;
float y = 101.1f;
boolean amIAwesome = true;

results in this:

When you declare and instantiate an object. The actual object goes on the heap. What goes on the stack? The address of the object on the heap. C++ programmers would call this a pointer, but some Java developers are racist against the word ""pointer"". Whatever. Just know that the address of the object goes in the stack.
Like so:
int problems = 99;
String name = ""Jay-Z"";


An array is an object, so it goes on the heap as well. And what about the objects in the array? They get their own heap space, and the address of each object goes inside the array.
JButton[] marxBros = new JButton[3];
marxBros[0] = new JButton(""Groucho"");
marxBros[1] = new JButton(""Zeppo"");
marxBros[2] = new JButton(""Harpo"");


So, what gets passed in when you call a method? If you pass in an object, what you're actually passing in is the address of the object. Some might say the ""value"" of the address, and some say it's just a reference to the object. This is the genesis of the holy war between ""reference"" and ""value"" proponents. What you call it isn't as important as that you understand that what's getting passed in is the address to the object.
private static void shout(String name){
    System.out.println(""There goes "" + name + ""!"");
}

public static void main(String[] args){
    String hisName = ""John J. Jingleheimerschmitz"";
    String myName = hisName;
    shout(myName);
}

One String gets created and space for it is allocated in the heap, and the address to the string is stored on the stack and given the identifier hisName, since the address of the second String is the same as the first, no new String is created and no new heap space is allocated, but a new identifier is created on the stack. Then we call shout(): a new stack frame is created and a new identifier, name is created and assigned the address of the already-existing String.

So, value, reference? You say ""potato"".

I'd rather avoid the kind of thing which ends up being pretty religious with relatively little basis (e.g. brace placing) but examples might include things like ""unit testing isn't actually terribly helpful"" or ""public fields are okay really"". The important thing (to me, anyway) is that you've got reasons behind your opinions.
Please present your opinion and reasoning - I would encourage people to vote for opinions which are well-argued and interesting, whether or not you happen to agree with them.

If you also need to detect different encodings, it can also distinguish among various different byte-order marks, e.g. UTF-8 vs. UTF-16 big + little endian - details at the doc link above.  You can then use the detected ByteOrderMark to choose a Charset to decode the stream.  (There's probably a more streamlined way to do this if you need all of this functionality - maybe the UnicodeReader in BalusC's answer?).  Note that, in general, there's not a very good way to detect what encoding some bytes are in, but if the stream starts with a BOM, apparently this can be helpful.
Edit: If you need to detect the BOM in UTF-16, UTF-32, etc, then the constructor should be:
new BOMInputStream(is, ByteOrderMark.UTF_8, ByteOrderMark.UTF_16BE,
        ByteOrderMark.UTF_16LE, ByteOrderMark.UTF_32BE, ByteOrderMark.UTF_32LE)

When using jagged arrays you can easily perform such operations as row swap and row resize. Maybe in some cases usage of multidimensional arrays will be more safe, but even Microsoft FxCop tells that jagged arrays should be used instead of multidimensional when you use it to analyse your projects.

4750313,219755.0,2011-01-20 17:16:54+00:00,2253110,68,"Don't write headings in CSS
Just split sections into files. Any CSS comments, should be just that, comments.
reset.css
base.css
somepage.css
someotherpage.css
some_abstract_component.css

Use a script to combine them into one; if necessary. You can even have a nice directory structure as well, and just have your script recursively scan for .css files.
If you must write headings, have a TOC at the start of the file
The headings in the TOC should be perfectly equal to headings you write later. It's a pain to search for headings. To add to the problem, how exactly is anyone suppose to know you have another header after your first header? ps. don't add doc-like * (star) at the start of each line when writing TOCs, it just makes it more annoying to select the text.
/* Table of Contents
   - - - - - - - - -
   Header stuff
   Body Stuff
   Some other junk
   - - - - - - - - -
 */
...
/* Header Stuff 
 */
...
/* Body Stuff 
 */

Write comments with or within the rules, not outside the block
First off, when you edit the script there is a 50/50 chance you'll pay attention to what is outside the rule block (particularly if it's a big glob of text ;) ). Secondly there is (almost) no case where you would need a ""comment"" outside. If it is outside, it is 99% of the time a title, so keep it like that.
Split the page into components
Components should have position:relative, no padding and no margin, most of the time. This simplifies % rules a lot, as well as allowing for much simpler absolute:position'ing of elements, since if there's a absolute positioned container the absolute positioned element will use the container when computing top, right, bottom, left properties. 
Most DIVs in a HTML5 document are usually a component. 
A component is also something that can be considered a independent unit on the page. In laymen's terms treat something like a component if it makes sense to treat something like a blackbox.
Going with the QA page example again:
#navigation
#question
#answers
#answers .answer
etc.

By splitting the page into components, you split your work into manageable units.
Put rules with a cumulative effect on the same line.
For example border, margin and padding (but not outline) all add to the dimensions and size of the element you are styling.
position: absolute; top: 10px; right: 10px;

If they are just not that readable on one line, at least put them in close proximity:
padding: 10px; margin: 20px;
border: 1px solid black;

Use shorthand when possible:
/* the following... */
padding-left: 10px;
padding-right: 10px;
/* can simply be written as */
padding: 0 10px;

Never repeat a selector
If you have more instances of the same selector, there's a good chance you'll inevitable end up with multiple instances of the same rules. For example:
#some .selector {
    margin: 0;
    font-size: 11px;
}
...
#some .selector {
    border: 1px solid #000;
    margin: 0;
}

Avoid using TAGs as selectors, when you can use id/classes
First off the DIV and SPAN tags are the exception: you should never use them, ever! ;) Only use them to attach a class/id.
This...
div#answers div.answer table.statistics {
    border-collapse: collapsed;
    color: pink;
    border: 1px solid #000;
}
div#answers div.answer table.statistics thead {
    outline: 3px solid #000;
}

Should be written like this:
#answers .answer .statistics {
    border-collapse: collapsed;
    color: pink;
    border: 1px solid #000;
}
#answers .answer .statistics thead {
    outline: 3px solid #000;
}

Because the extra dangling DIVs there add nothing to the selector. They also force a unnecessary tag-rule. If you were to change, for example, .answer from a div to a article your style would break.
Or if you prefer more clarity:
#answers .answer .statistics {
    color: pink;
    border: 1px solid #000;
}
#answers .answer table.statistics {
    border-collapse: collapsed;
}
#answers .answer .statistics thead {
    outline: 3px solid #000;
}

The reason being the border-collapse property is a special property that only makes sense when applied to a table. If .statistics is not a table it should not apply.
Generic rules are evil!

avoid writing generic/magic rules if you can
unless it's for a CSS-reset/unreset, all your generic magic should apply to at least one root component

They don't save you time, they make your head explode; as well as make maintenance a nightmare. When you're writing the rule, you may know where they apply, however that has no guarantee your rule won't mess with you later on. 
To add to this generic rules are confusing and hard to read, even if you have some idea of the document you're styling. This is not to say you shouldn't write generic rules, just don't use them unless you truly intend for them to be generic, and even them add as much scope information into the selector as you can.
Stuff like this...
.badges {
    width: 100%;
    white-space: nowrap;
}

address {
    padding: 5px 10px;
    border: 1px solid #ccc;
}

...has the same problem as using global variables in a programing language. You need to give them scope!
#question .userinfo .badges {
    width: 100%;
    white-space: nowrap;
}

#answers .answer .userinfo address {
    padding: 5px 10px;
    border: 1px solid #ccc;
}

Basically that reads as:
components                   target
---------------------------- --------
#answers .answer   .userinfo address
-------- --------- --------- --------
domain   component component selector 

I like using IDs whenever a component I know is a singleton on a page; your needs may be different.
Note: Ideally, you should write just enough. Mentioning more components in the selector however is the more forgiving mistake, compared to mentioning less components.
Lets assume you have a pagination component. You use it in many places across your site. This would be a good example of when you would be writing a generic rule. Lets say you display:block the individual page number links and give them a dark gray background. For them to be visible you have to have rules like this:
.pagination .pagelist a {
    color: #fff;
}

Now lets say you use your pagination for a list of answers, you may encounter something like this
#answers .header a {
    color: #000;
}
...
.pagination .pagelist a {
    color: #fff;
}

This will make your white links black, which you don't want. 
The incorrect way to fix it is:
.pagination .pagelist a {
    color: #fff !important;
}

The correct way to fix it is:
#answers .header .pagination .pagelist a {
    color: #fff;
}

Complex ""logic"" comments don't work :)
If you write something like: ""this value is dependent on blah-blah combined with height of blah-blah"", it's just inevitable you'll make a mistake and it will all fall down like a house of cards.
Keep your comments simple; if you need ""logical operations"" consider one of those CSS templating languages like SASS or LESS.
How do you do I write a color pallet?
Leave this for the end. Have a file for your entire color pallet. With out this file your style should still have some usable color-pallet in the rules. Your color pallet should overwrite. You chain selectors using a very high level parent component (eg. #page) and then write your style as a self sufficient rule block. It can be just color or something more.
eg.
#page #header .description,
#page #categories .description,
#page #answers .answer .body
{
    color: #222; background: #fff; 
    border-radius: 10px;
    padding: 1em;
}

The idea is simple, your color pallet is a stylesheet independent of the base style, which you cascade into.
Less names, requires less memory, making the code easier to read
Using fewer names is better. Ideally use very simple (and short!) words: text, body, header. 
I also find combination of simple words is easier to understand then having a soup of long ""appropriate"" words: postbody, posthead, userinfo, etc. 
Keep the vocabulary small, this way even if some stranger coming in to read your style-soup (like yourself after a few weeks ;)) only needs to understand where words are used rather where every selector is used. For example I use .this whenever a element is supposedly ""the selected item"" or ""the current item"", etc.
Clean up after yourself
Writing CSS is like eating, sometimes you leave a mess behind. Make sure you clean up that mess, or the garbage code will just pile up. Remove classes/ids you don't use. Remove CSS rules you don't use. Make sure everything is nice a tight and you don't have conflicting or duplicated rules. 
If you, as I suggested, treated some containers as black-boxes (components) in your style, used those components in your selectors, and kept everything in one dedicated file (or properly split a file with a TOC and headers), then your work is substantially easier...
You can use a tool such as the firefox extension Dust-Me Selectors (tip: point it to your sitemap.xml) to help you find some of the junk hidden in your css nukes and carnies.
Keep a unsorted.css file
Say you are styling a QA site, and you already have a stylesheet for the ""answers page"", which we will call answers.css. If you now need to add a lot of new css, add it to the unsorted.css stylesheet then refactor into your answers.css stylesheet. 
Several reasons for this:

it's faster to refactor in after you're finished, then it is to search for rules (that probably don't exist) and inject code
you will write stuff that you will remove, injecting code just makes it harder to remove that code
appending to the original file easily leads to rule/selector duplication

Basically, it has a service that starts a timer for your idle duration that can be disrupted by user activity (events, such as clicking, scrolling, typing). You can also manually interrupt the timeout by calling a method on the service. If the timeout is not disrupted, then it counts down a warning where you could alert the user they are going to be logged out. If they do not respond after the warning countdown reaches 0, an event is broadcasted that your application can respond to. In your case, it could issue a request to kill their session and redirect to a login page.
Additionally, it has a keep-alive service that can ping some URL at an interval. This can be used by your app to keep a user's session alive while they are active. The idle service by default integrates with the keep-alive service, suspending the pinging if they become idle, and resuming it when they return.
All the info you need to get started is on the site with more details in the wiki. However, here's a snippet of config showing how to sign them out when they time out.

if 200 ... 299 ~= statusCode {

Or a switch-statement with an expression pattern (which uses the pattern-match
operator internally):
switch statusCode {
case 200 ... 299:
    println(""success"")
default:
    println(""failure"")
}

Note that ..< denotes a range that omits the upper value, so you probably want
200 ... 299 or 200 ..< 300.
Additional information: When the above code is compiled in Xcode 6.3 with
optimizations switch on, then for the test
if 200 ... 299 ~= statusCode

actually no function call is generated at all, only three assembly instruction:
addq    $-200, %rdi
cmpq    $99, %rdi
ja  LBB0_1

this is exactly the same assembly code that is generated for
if statusCode >= 200 && statusCode <= 299

You can verify that with

xcrun -sdk macosx swiftc -O -emit-assembly main.swift

As of Swift 2, this can be written as
if case 200 ... 299 = statusCode {
    print(""success"")
}

using the newly introduced pattern-matching for if-statements.

ext.libraries = [ // Groovy map literal

From a child script, you can then use the dependency declarations like so:

To share dependency declarations with advanced configuration options, you can use DependencyHandler.create:

dependencies { compile libraries.spring } will then add both dependencies at once.

In theory, the content of HTTP responses are protected by the Same Origin Policy: pages from one domain cannot get any informations from pages on an other domain (unless explicitly allowed).
An attacker can request pages on other domains on your behalf, e.g. by using a <script src=...> or <img>tag, but it can't get any information about the result (headers, contents).
Thus, if you visit an attacker's page, it couldn't read your email from gmail.com.
Except that when using a script tag to request JSON content, the JSON is executed as Javascript in an attacker's controlled environment. If the attacker can replace the Array or Object constructor or some other method used during object construction, anything in the JSON would pass through the attacker's code, and be disclosed.  
Note that this happens at the time the JSON is executed as Javascript, not at the time it's parsed.
There are multiple counter measures:
Making sure the JSON never executes
By placing a while(1); statement before the JSON data, Google makes sure that the JSON data is never executed as Javascript.
Only a legitimate page could actually get the whole content, strip the while(1);, and parse the remainder as JSON.
Making sure the JSON is not valid Javascript
Similarly, adding invalid tokens before the JSON, like &&&START&&&, makes sure that it is never executed.
Always return JSON with an Object on the outside
This is OWASP recommended way to protect from JSON hijacking, and is the less intrusive one.
Similarly to the the previous counter-measures, it makes sure that the JSON is never executed as Javascript.
A valid JSON object, when not enclosed by anything, is not valid in Javascript:
eval('{""foo"":""bar""}')
// SyntaxError: Unexpected token :

This is however valid JSON:
JSON.parse('{""foo"":""bar""}')
// Object {foo: ""bar""}

So, making sure you always return an Object at the top level of the response makes sure that the JSON is not valid Javascript, while still being valid JSON.
Comparison of above methods
The OWASP way is less intrusive, as it needs no client library changes, and transfers valid JSON. It is unsure whether past or future browser bugs could defeat this, however.  As noted by @oriadam, it is unclear whether data could be leaked through an error handling or not (e.g. window.onerror).
Google's way requires client library in order for it to support automatic de-serialization, and can be considered to be safer with regard to browser bugs.
Both methods require server changes in order to avoid developers from accidentally sending vulnerable JSON.

  ['remindOnRespondedEventsOnly','true'],
  ['hideInvitations_remindOnRespondedEventsOnly','false_true'],
  ['Calendar ID stripped for privacy','false'],['smsVerifiedFlag','true']]]]

I would assume this is to prevent people from doing an eval() on it, but all you'd really have to do is replace the while and then you'd be set. I would assume the eval prevention is to make sure people write safe JSON parsing code.
I've seen this used in a couple of other places, too, but a lot more so with Google (Mail, Calendar, Contacts, etc.) Strangely enough, Google Docs starts with &&&START&&& instead, and Google Contacts seems to start with while(1); &&&START&&&.

Is there some way I can increase the resolution of x-tick labels - even to the point of one for each bar/bin?
(Ideally, I'd also like the seconds to be reformatted in micro-seconds/milli-seconds, but that's a question for another day).
Secondly, I'd like each individual bar labeled - with the actual number in that bin, as well as the percentage of the total of all bins.

HorizontalAlignment=""Stretch"" VerticalAlignment=""Stretch""

This is the default for almost controls, so in general you don't have to do anything at all to have a WPF control fill its parent container:  They do so automatically.  This is true for all containers that don't squeeze their children to minimum size.
Common Mistakes
I will now explain several common mistakes that prevent HorizontalAlignment=""Stretch"" VerticalAlignment=""Stretch"" from working as expected.
1. Explicit Height or Width
One common mistake is to explicitly specify a Width or Height for a control.  So if you have this:
<Grid>
  <Button Content=""Why am I not filling the window?"" Width=""200"" Height=""20"" />
  ...
</Grid>

Just remove the Width and Height attributes:
<Grid>
  <Button Content=""Ahhh... problem solved"" />
  ...
</Grid>

2. Containing panel squeezes control to minimum size
Another common mistake is to have the containing panel squeezing your control as tight as it will go.  For example a vertical StackPanel will always squeeze its contents vertically as small as they will go:
<StackPanel>
  <Button Content=""Why am I squished flat?"" />
</StackPanel>

Change to another Panel and you'll be good to go:
<DockPanel>
  <Button Content=""I am no longer squished."" />
</DockPanel>

Also, any Grid row or column whose height is ""Auto"" will similarly squeeze its content in that direction.
Some examples of containers that don't squeeze their children are:

ContentControls never squeeze their children (this includes Border, Button, CheckBox, ScrollViewer, and many others)
Grid with a single row and column
Grid with ""*"" sized rows and columns
DockPanel doesn't squeeze its last child
TabControl doesn't squeeze its content

Some examples of containers that do squeeze their children are:

StackPanel squeezes in its Orientation direction
Grid with an ""Auto"" sized row or column squeezes in that direction
DockPanel squeezes all but its last child in their dock direction
TabControl squeezes its header (what is displayed on the tab)

3. Explicit Height or Width further out
It's amazing how many times I see Grid or DockPanel given an explicit height and width, like this:
<Grid Width=""200"" Height=""100"">
  <Button Content=""I am unnecessarily constrainted by my containing panel"" />
</Grid>

In general you never want to give any Panel an explicit Height or Width.  My first step when diagnosing layout problems is to remove every explicit Height or Width I can find.
4. Window is SizeToContent when it shouldn't be
When you use SizeToContent, your content will be squeezed to minimum size.  In many applications this is very useful and is the correct choice.  But if your content has no ""natural"" size then you'll probably want to omit SizeToContent.

I'd like to globally catch any unhandled exception and log them, but otherwise continue program execution as if nothing happened (kinda like VB's On Error Resume Next).
Is this possible in C#? And if so, where exactly would I need to put the exception handling code?
Currently I can't see any single point where I could wrap a try/catch around and which would catch all exceptions that could occur. And even then I would have left whatever has been executed because of the catch. Or am I thinking in horribly wrong directions here?
ETA: Because many people below pointed it out: The application is not for controlling nuclear power plants. If it crashes it's not that much a big deal but random exceptions that are mostly UI-related are a nuisance in the context where it would be used. There were (and probably still are) a few of those and since it uses a plugin architecture and may be extended by others (also students in that case; so no experienced developers that are able to write completely error-free code).
As for the exceptions that get caught: I do log them to a log file, including the complete stack trace. That was the whole point of that exercise. Just to counter those people  that were taking my analogy to VB's OERN too literally.
I know that blindly ignoring certain classes of errors is dangerous and might corrupt my application instance. As said before, this program isn't mission-critical for anyone. No-one in their right mind would bet the survival of the human civilization on it. It's simply a little tool for testing certain design approaches wrt. software engineering.
For the immediate use of the application there are not many things that can happen on an exception:

No exception handling â error dialog and application exit. Experiment has to be repeated, though likely with another subject. No errors have been logged, which is unfortunate.
Generic exception handling â benign error trapped, no harm done. This should be the common case judged from all errors we were seeing during development. Ignoring this kind of errors should have no immediate consequences; the core data structures are tested well enough that they will easily survive this.
Generic exception handling â serious error trapped, possibly crash at a later point. This may happen rarely. We've never seen it so far. The error is logged anyway and a crash might be inevitable. So this is conceptually similar to the very first case. Except that we have a stack trace. And in the majority of cases the user won't even notice.

As for the experiment data generated by the program: A serious error would at worst just cause no data to be recorded. Subtle changes that change the result of the experiment ever so slightly are pretty unlikely. And even in that case, if the results seem dubious the error was logged; one can still throw away that data point if it's a total outlier.
To summarize: Yes, I consider myself still at least partially sane and I don't consider a global exception handling routine which leaves the program running to be necessarily totally evil. As said twice before, such a decision might be valid, depending on the application. In this case it was judged a valid decision and not total and utter bullshit. For any other application that decision might look different. But please don't accuse me or the other people who worked on that project to potentially blow up the world just because we're ignoring errors.
Side note: There is exactly one user for that application. It's not something like Windows or Office that gets used by millions where the cost of having exceptions bubble to the user at all would be very different in the first place already.

2145551,15401.0,2010-01-27 08:58:59+00:00,2145510,239,"The Birthday Paradox, or why PRNGs produce duplicates more often than you might think.
There are a couple of issues at play in the OP's problem.  One is the birthday paradox as mentioned above and the second is the nature of what you are generating, which does not inherently guarantee that a given number will not be repeated.  
The Birthday Paradox applies where given value can occur more than once during the period of the generator - and therefore duplicates can happen within a sample of values.  The effect of the Birthday Paradox is that the real likelihood of getting such duplicates is quite significant and the average period between them is smaller than one might otherwise have thought.  This dissonance between the percived and actual probabilities makes the Birthday Paradox a good example example of a cognitive bias, where a naive intuitive estimate is likely to be wildly wrong.
A quick primer on Pseudo Random Number Generators (PRNGs)
The first part of your problem is that you are taking the exposed value of a random number generator and converting it to a much smaller number, so the space of possible values is reduced.  Although some pseudo-random number generators do not repeat values during their period this transformation changes the domain to a much smaller one.  The smaller domain invalidates the 'no repeats' condition so you can expect a significant likelihood of repeats.   
Some algorithms, such as the linear congruential PRNG (A'=AX|M) do guarantee uniqueness for the entire period.  In a LCG the generated value contains the entire state of the accumulator and no additional state is held.  The generator is deterministic and cannot repeat a number within the period - any given accumulator value can imply only one possible successive value.  Therefore, each value can only occur once within the period of the generator.  However, the period of such a PRNG is relatively small - about 2^30 for typical implementations of the LCG algorithm - and cannot possibly be larger than the number of distinct values.
Not all PRNG algorithms share this characteristic; some can repeat a given value within the period.  In the OP's problem the Mersenne Twister algorithm (used in Python's random module) has a very long period - much greater than 2^32.   Unlike a Linear Congruential PRNG, the result is not purely a function of the previous output value as the accumulator contains additional state.  With 32 bit integer output and a period of ~2^19937 it cannot possibly provide a such a guarantee.  
The Mersenne Twister is a popular algorithm for PRNGs because it has good statistical and geometric properties and a very long period - desirable characteristics for a PRNG used on simulation models.   

Good statistical properties mean that the numbers generated by the algorithm are evenly distributed with no numbers having a significantly higher probability of appearing than others.  Poor statistical properties could produce unwanted skew in the results.
Good geometric properies mean that sets of N numbers do not lie on a hyperplane in N dimensional space.  Poor geometric properties can generate spurious correlations in a simulation model and distort the results.
A long period means that you can generate a lot of numbers before the sequence wraps around to the start.  If a model needs a large number of iterations or has to be run from several seeds then the 2^30 or so discrete numbers available from a typical LCG implementation may not be sufficient.  The MT19337 algorithm has a very long period - 2^19337-1, or about 10^5821.  By comparison the total number of atoms in the universe is estimated at about 10^80.

The 32 bit integer produced by a MT19337 PRNG cannot possibly represent enough discrete values to avoid repeating during such a large period.  In this case duplicate values are likely to occur and inevitable with a large enough sample.  
The Birthday Paradox in a nutshell
This problem is originally defined as the probability of any two people in the room sharing the same birthday.  The key point is that any two people in the room could share a birthday.  People tend to naively misinterpret the problem as the probability of someone in the room sharing a birthday with a specific individual, which is the source of the cognitive bias that often causes people to underestimate the probability.  This is the incorrect assumption - there is no requirement for the match to be to a specific individual and any two individuals could match.  

The probability of a match occurring between any two individuals is much higher than the probability of a match to a specific individual as the match does not have to be to a specific date.  Rather, you only have to find two individuals that share the same birthday.  From this graph (which can be found on the wikipedia page on the subject), we can see that we only need 23 people in the room for there to be a 50% chance of finding two that match in this way.
From the Wikipedia entry on the subject we can get a nice summary.  In the OP's problem we have 4,500 possible 'birthdays', rather than 365.  For a given number of random values generated (equating to 'people') we want to know the probability of any two identical values appearing within the sequence.  
Computing the likely effect of the Birthday Paradox on the OP's problem
For a sequence of 100 numbers, we have  pairs (see Understanding the Problem) that could potentially match (i.e. the first could match with the second, third etc., the second could match the third, fourth etc. and so on), so the number of combinations that could potentially match is rather more than just 100.  
From Calculating the Probability we get an expression of .  The following snippet of Python code below does a naive evaluation of the probability of a matching pair occurring.  
# === birthday.py ===========================================
#
from math import log10, factorial

PV=4500          # Number of possible values
SS=100           # Sample size

# These intermediate results are exceedingly large numbers;
# Python automatically starts using bignums behind the scenes.
#
numerator = factorial (PV)          
denominator = (PV ** SS) * factorial (PV - SS)

# Now we need to get from bignums to floats without intermediate
# values too large to cast into a double.  Taking the logs and 
# subtracting them is equivalent to division.

log_prob_no_pair = log10 (numerator) - log10 (denominator)

# We've just calculated the log of the probability that *NO*

# of at least one collision is 1.0 - the probability that no

print 1.0 - (10 ** log_prob_no_pair)

This produces a sensible looking result of p=0.669 for a match occuring within 100 numbers sampled from a population of 4500 possible values. (Maybe someone could verify this and post a comment if it's wrong).  From this we can see that the lengths of runs between matching numbers observed by the OP seem to be quite reasonable.
Footnote: using shuffling to get a unique sequence of pseudo-random numbers 
See this answer below from S. Mark for a means of getting a guaranteed unique set of random numbers.  The technique the poster refers to takes an array of numbers (which you supply, so you can make them unique) and shuffles them into random order.  Drawing the numbers in sequence from the shuffled array will give you a sequence of pseudo-random numbers that are guaranteed not to repeat.
Footnote: Cryptographically Secure PRNGs 
The MT algorithm is not cryptographically secure as it is relatively easy to infer the internal state of the generator by observing a sequence of numbers.  Other algorithms such as Blum Blum Shub are used for cryptographic applications, but may be unsuitable for simulation or general random number applications.  Cryptographically secure PRNGs may be expensive (perhaps requiring bignum calculations) or may not have good geometric properties.  In the case of this type of algorithm the primary requirement is that it should be computationally infeasible to infer the internal state of the generator by observing a sequence of values.

To map [0.5, 1] to [0, 1] we will seek a linear map of the form x -> ax + b. We will require that endpoints are mapped to endpoints and that order is preserved. 
Method one: The requirement that endpoints are mapped to endpoints and that order is preserved implies that 0.5 is mapped to 0 and 1 is mapped to 1
a * (0.5) + b = 0 (1)
a * 1 + b = 1     (2)

This is a simultaneous system of linear equations and can be solved by multiplying equation (1) by -2 and adding equation (1) to equation (2). Upon doing this we obtain b = -1 and substituting this back into equation (2) we obtain that a = 2. Thus the map x -> 2x - 1 will do the trick.
Method two: The slope of a line passing through two points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) is
(y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1).

Here we will use the points (0.5, 0) and (1, 1) to meet the requirement that endpoints are mapped to endpoints and that the map is order-preserving. Therefore the slope is
m = (1 - 0) / (1 - 0.5) = 1 / 0.5 = 2.

We have that (1, 1) is a point on the line and therefore by the point-slope form of an equation of a line we have that
y - 1 = 2 * (x - 1) = 2x - 2

so that
y = 2x - 1.

Once again we see that x -> 2x - 1 is a map that will do the trick.

11018418,134841.0,2012-06-13 15:35:00+00:00,11016220,201,"Inline namespaces are a library versioning feature akin to symbol versioning, but implemented purely at the C++11 level (ie. cross-platform) instead of being a feature of a specific binary executable format (ie. platform-specific).
It is a mechanism by which a library author can make a nested namespace look and act as if all its declarations were in the surrounding namespace (inline namespaces can be nested, so ""more-nested"" names percolate up all the way to the first non-inline namespace and look and act as if their declarations were in any of the namespaces in between, too).
As an example, consider the STL implementation of vector. If we had inline namespaces from the beginning of C++, then in C++98 the header <vector> might have looked like this:
namespace std {

#if __cplusplus < 1997L // pre-standard C++
    inline
#endif

    namespace pre_cxx_1997 {
        template <class T> __vector_impl; // implementation class
        template <class T> // e.g. w/o allocator argument
        class vector : __vector_impl<T> { // private inheritance
            // ...
        };
    }
#if __cplusplus >= 1997L // C++98/03 or later
                         // (ifdef'ed out b/c it probably uses new language
                         // features that a pre-C++98 compiler would choke on)
#  if __cplusplus == 1997L // C++98/03
    inline
#  endif

    namespace cxx_1997 {

        // std::vector now has an allocator argument
        template <class T, class Alloc=std::allocator<T> >
        class vector : pre_cxx_1997::__vector_impl<T> { // the old impl is still good
            // ...
        };

        // and vector<bool> is special:
        template <class Alloc=std::allocator<bool> >
        class vector<bool> {
            // ...
        };

    };

#endif // C++98/03 or later

} // namespace std

Depending on the value of __cplusplus, either one or the other vector implementation is chosen. If your codebase was written in pre-C++98 times, and you find that the C++98 version of vector is causing trouble for you when you upgrade your compiler, ""all"" you have to do is to find the references to std::vector in your codebase and replace them by std::pre_cxx_1997::vector.
Come the next standard, and the STL vendor just repeats the procedure again, introducing a new namespace for std::vector with emplace_back support (which requires C++11) and inlining that one iff __cplusplus == 201103L.
OK, so why do I need a new language feature for this? I can already do the following to have the same effect, no?
namespace std {

    namespace pre_cxx_1997 {
        // ...
    }
#if __cplusplus < 1997L // pre-standard C++
    using namespace pre_cxx_1997;
#endif

#if __cplusplus >= 1997L // C++98/03 or later
                         // (ifdef'ed out b/c it probably uses new language
                         // features that a pre-C++98 compiler would choke on)

    namespace cxx_1997 {
        // ...
    };
#  if __cplusplus == 1997L // C++98/03
    using namespace cxx_1997;
#  endif

#endif // C++98/03 or later

} // namespace std

Depending on the value of __cplusplus, I get either one or the other of the implementations.
And you'd be almost correct.
Consider the following valid C++98 user code (it was permitted to fully specialize templates that live in namespace std in C++98 already):
// I don't trust my STL vendor to do this optimisation, so force these 
// specializations myself:
namespace std {
    template <>
    class vector<MyType> : my_special_vector<MyType> {
        // ...
    };
    template <>
    class vector<MyOtherType> : my_special_vector<MyOtherType> {
        // ...
    };
    // ...etc...
} // namespace std

This is perfectly valid code where the user supplies its own implementation of a vector for a set of type where she apparently knows a more efficient implementation than the one found in (her copy of) the STL.
But: When specializing a template, you need to do so in the namespace it was declared in. The Standard says that vector is declared in namespace std, so that's where the user rightfully expects to specialize the type.
This code works with a non-versioned namespace std, or with the C++11 inline namespace feature, but not with the versioning trick that used using namespace <nested>, because that exposes the implementation detail that the true namespace in which vector was defined was not std directly.
There are other holes by which you could detect the nested namespace (see comments below), but inline namespaces plug them all. And that's all there is to it. Immensely useful for the future, but AFAIK the Standard doesn't prescribe inline namespace names for its own standard library (I'd love to be proven wrong on this, though), so it can only be used for third-party libraries, not the standard itself (unless the compiler vendors agree on a naming scheme).

Java evaluates trig functions in software rather than hardware, and so it runs much slower.)
Chips do not use Taylor series to compute trig functions, at least not entirely.

What is the =+ operator?

That's two operators, one assignment operator, =, and one unary plus, +, which does nothing.
Did you typo and mean the compund assignment operator +=?

What is the +++ operator?

Also two operators, one post-increment, ++, and one addition, +, (per the maximal munch rule, the longest valid token is chosen, it would become one addition and two unary plus if the shortest valid token were chosen).

What is the - - operator?

Again two operators, one subtraction, and one unary minus (negation).

What is the |= operator?

A compound assignment, bitwise-oring [or, in the case of boolean values, logical-oring] the left-hand-side value with the right-hand-side value and storing that in the left-hand-side variable.
a |= b;

is nearly equivalent to
a = a | b;

but the left-hand-side operand is evaluated only once, and the latter may need an explicit cast where the former doesn't.
k = (j = (i = 0) + 2) + 1;
return i|= j|= k|= (j+= i) - - (k+++k) - - (i =+j);


It produces a value of 11. How does this work?

The first line is equivalent to
i = 0;
j = i+2;
k = j+1;

The assignment (i = 0 for example) evaluates to the value stored (in i here).
The next line is, with proper spacing, and implicit parentheses added
return i |= (j |= (k |= (((j += i) - (-(k++ + k))) - (-(i = +j)))));


i |= stuff_1: i is evaluated (0), stuff_1 is evaluated, the bitwise or is taken, and the result stored in i. Since i is originally 0, that is equivalent to i = stuff_1.
j |= stuff_2: j is evaluated (2), stuff_2 is evaluated, the bitwise or is taken, and the result is stored in j.
k |= stuff_3: k is evaluated (3), then stuff_3, left-to-right.

(j += i) adds i to j, stores the sum in j and returns j's new value.
Since i is 0, j doesn't change and the value is 2.
(k++ + k) takes the old value of k (3), increments k and adds k's new value (4), resulting in 7. That value is negated, and the negated value (-7) subtracted from 2, resulting in 2 - (-7) = 9.
(i = +j) stores the value of j (2) in i and the value of the expression is also 2. The value is negated (-2) and subtracted from the 9 we got from the previous operations, so stuff_3 evaluates to 11, with the side effects that

the stored value of i is now 2
the stored value of j is now 2 (didn't actually change, since i was 0 initially)
the stored value of k is now 4

the old value of k (3) is bitwise or'ed with 11, resulting in 11, that is stored in k, and 11 is the value of stuff_2, which is k |= stuff_3.

the old value of j (2) is bitwise or'ed with the value of stuff_2 (11), resulting in 11. The value is stored in j, and the value of stuff_1 (j |= stuff_2) is 11.
the old value of i (0) is bitwise or'ed with the value of stuff_1 (11), the result sored in i, and the value of i |= stuff_1 is 11. That value is then returned.

79845,13940.0,2008-09-17 04:02:23+00:00,4080,60,"For static analysis tools I often use CPD, PMD, FindBugs, and Checkstyle.
CPD is the PMD ""Copy/Paste Detector"" tool. I was using PMD for a little while before I noticed the ""Finding Duplicated Code"" link on the PMD web page.
I'd like to point out that these tools can sometimes be extended beyond their ""out-of-the-box"" set of rules. And not just because they're open source so that you can rewrite them. Some of these tools come with applications or ""hooks"" that allow them to be extended. For example, PMD comes with the ""designer"" tool that allows you to create new rules. Also, Checkstyle has the DescendantToken check that has properties that allow for substantial customization.
I integrate these tools with an Ant-based build. You can follow the link to see my commented configuration.
In addition to the simple integration into the build, I find it helpful to configure the tools to be somewhat ""integrated"" in a couple of other ways. Namely, report generation and warning suppression uniformity. I'd like to add these aspects to this discussion (which should probably have the ""static-analysis"" tag also): how are folks configuring these tools to create a ""unified"" solution? (I've asked this question separately here)
First, for warning reports, I transform the output so that each warning has the simple format:
/absolute-path/filename:line-number:column-number: warning(tool-name): message
This is often called the ""Emacs format,"" but even if you aren't using Emacs, it's a reasonable format for homogenizing reports. For example:
/project/src/com/example/Foo.java:425:9: warning(Checkstyle):Missing a Javadoc comment.
My warning format transformations are done by my Ant script with Ant filterchains.
The second ""integration"" that I do is for warning suppression. By default, each tool supports comments or an annotation (or both) that you can place in your code to silence a warning that you want to ignore. But these various warning suppression requests do not have a consistent look which seems somewhat silly. When you're suppressing a warning, you're suppressing a warning, so why not always write ""SuppressWarning?""
For example, PMD's default configuration suppresses warning generation on lines of code with the string ""NOPMD"" in a comment. Also, PMD supports Java's @SuppressWarnings annotation. I configure PMD to use comments containing ""SuppressWarning(PMD."" instead of NOPMD so that PMD suppressions look alike. I fill in the particular rule that is violated when using the comment style suppression:
// SuppressWarnings(PMD.PreserveStackTrace) justification: (false positive) exceptions are chained
Only the ""SuppressWarnings(PMD."" part is significant for a comment, but it is consistent with PMD's support for the @SuppressWarning annotation which does recognize individual rule violations by name:
@SuppressWarnings(""PMD.CompareObjectsWithEquals"") // justification: identity comparision intended
Similarly, Checkstyle suppresses warning generation between pairs of comments (no annotation support is provided). By default, comments to turn Checkstyle off and on contain the strings CHECKSTYLE:OFF and CHECKSTYLE:ON, respectively. Changing this configuration (with Checkstyle's ""SuppressionCommentFilter"") to use the strings ""BEGIN SuppressWarnings(CheckStyle."" and ""END SuppressWarnings(CheckStyle."" makes the controls look more like PMD:

// BEGIN SuppressWarnings(Checkstyle.HiddenField) justification: ""Effective Java,"" 2nd ed., Bloch, Item 2
// END SuppressWarnings(Checkstyle.HiddenField)

With Checkstyle comments, the particular check violation (HiddenField) is significant because each check has its own ""BEGIN/END"" comment pair.
FindBugs also supports warning generation suppression with a @SuppressWarnings annotation, so no further configuration is required to achieve some level of uniformity with other tools. Unfortunately, Findbugs has to support a custom @SuppressWarnings annotation because the built-in Java @SuppressWarnings annotation has a SOURCE retention policy which is not strong enough to retain the annotation in the class file where FindBugs needs it. I fully qualify FindBugs warnings suppressions to avoid clashing with Java's @SuppressWarnings annotation:
@edu.umd.cs.findbugs.annotations.SuppressWarnings(""UWF_FIELD_NOT_INITIALIZED_IN_CONSTRUCTOR"")
These techniques makes things look reasonably consistent across tools. Note that having each warning suppression contain the string ""SuppressWarnings"" makes it easy to run a simple search to find all instances for all tools over an entire code base.

1454992,134554.0,2009-09-21 15:05:47+00:00,1453410,76,"Several things to point out.
First of all, you cannot assign an array object as you do here:
char A[WIDTH][HEIGHT];  
A=rand_grid(WIDTH,HEIGHT);

Objects of array type are not modifiable.  
Secondly, functions in C cannot return array types.  They can return pointers to arrays, though:
char (*foo(int width))[HEIGHT]
{
  /**
   * dynamically allocate memory for a widthxHEIGHT array of char
   */
  char (*newArr)[HEIGHT] = malloc(sizeof *newArr * width);
  /**
   * initialize array contents here
   */
  return newArr;
}

The syntax is a little confusing; it reads as 
       foo                                   -- foo
       foo(int width)                        -- is a function
                                             -- taking an int parameter
      *foo(int width)                        -- returning a pointer
     (*foo(int width))[HEIGHT]               -- to a HEIGHT-element array
char (*foo(int width))[HEIGHT]               -- of char

For C89, HEIGHT in the above snippet must be a compile-time constant integral expression (either a macro, a numeric literal, or an arithmetic expression consisting of macros and/or numeric literals).  I'm not sure if that's also true for C99.  
Based on the snippet you've posted, what you want to do is to take an array you've already allocated and initialize its contents.  Remember that in most contexts, an expression of an array type will implicitly be converted to a pointer to the base type.  IOW, if you pass an N-element array of T to a function, what the function actually receives is a pointer to T:
void foo (T *p) {...}
...
T arr[N];
foo(arr);

For 2-d arrays, it's a little uglier:
void foo (T (*p)[M]) {...}
...
T arr[N][M];
foo(arr);

This also relies on M being known at compile time, which limits the function's usefulness.  What you'd like is a function that can deal with a 2-d array of arbitrary size.  The best way I know of to accomplish this is instead of passing a pointer to the array, pass the address of the first element in the array[1], and pass the number of rows and columns as separate parameters:
void foo(T *base, size_t rows, size_t cols) {...}
...
T arr[N][M];
foo (&arr[0][0], N, M);

So your rand_grid function would look something like this:
void rand_grid(char *base, size_t rows, size_t cols)
{
  size_t i, j;
  for (i = 0; i < rows; i++)
  {
    for (j = 0; j < cols; j++)
    {
      /**
       * Since base is a simple char *, we must index it
       * as though it points to a 1-d array.  This works if
       * base points to the first element of a 2-d array,
       * since multi-dimensional arrays are contiguous.  
       */
      base[i*cols+j] = initial_value();
    }
  }
}

int main(void)
{
  char A[WIDTH][HEIGHT];
  rand_grid(&A[0][0], WIDTH, HEIGHT);
  ...
}



Even though the expressions &A[0][0] and A yield the same value (the base address of A), the types of the two expressions are different.  The first expression evaluates to a simple pointer to char (char *), while the second evaluates to a pointer to a 2-d array of char (char (*)[HEIGHT]).

What is meant by immutable?
StringBuilder and StringBuffer in Java


As for the code that OP needs help with, here's a typical solution of using a special value (usually null for reference types) to indicate success/failure:
Instead of:
String oPerson= null;
if (CheckAddress(""5556"", oPerson)) {
   print(oPerson); // DOESN'T ""WORK""! Java passes by value; String is immutable!
}

private boolean CheckAddress(String iAddress, String oPerson) {
   // on search succeeded:
   oPerson = something; // DOESN'T ""WORK""!
   return true;
   :
   // on search failed:
   return false;
}

Use a String return type instead, with null to indicate failure.
String person = checkAddress(""5556"");
if (person != null) {
   print(person);
}

private String checkAddress(String address) {
   // on search succeeded:
   return something;
   :
   // on search failed:
   return null;
}

This is how java.io.BufferedReader.readLine() works, for example: it returns instanceof String (perhaps an empty string!), until it returns null to indicate end of ""search"".
This is not limited to a reference type return value, of course. The key is that there has to be some special value(s) that is never a valid value, and you use that value for special purposes.
Another classic example is String.indexOf: it returns -1 to indicate search failure.

Note: because Java doesn't have a concept of ""input"" and ""output"" parameters, using the i- and o- prefix (e.g. iAddress, oPerson) is unnecessary and unidiomatic.


A more general solution
If you need to return several values, usually they're related in some way (e.g. x and y coordinates of a single Point). The best solution would be to encapsulate these values together. People have used an Object[] or a List<Object>, or a generic Pair<T1,T2>, but really, your own type would be best.
For this problem, I recommend an immutable SearchResult type like this to encapsulate the boolean and String search results:
public class SearchResult {
   public final String name;
   public final boolean isFound;

   public SearchResult(String name, boolean isFound) {
      this.name = name;
      this.isFound = isFound;
   }
}

Then in your search function, you do the following:
private SearchResult checkAddress(String address) {
  // on address search succeed
  return new SearchResult(foundName, true);
  :
  // on address search failed
  return new SearchResult(null, false);
}

And then you use it like this:
SearchResult sr = checkAddress(""5556"");
if (sr.isFound) {
  String name = sr.name;
  //...
}

If you want, you can (and probably should) make the final immutable fields non-public, and use public getters instead.

See the article in my blog for detailed performance comparison:

INNER JOIN vs. CROSS APPLY

CROSS APPLY works better on things that have no simple JOIN condition.
This one selects 3 last records from t2 for each record from t1:
SELECT  t1.*, t2o.*
FROM    t1
CROSS APPLY
        (
        SELECT  TOP 3 *
        FROM    t2

        ORDER BY
                t2.rank DESC
        ) t2o

It cannot be easily formulated with an INNER JOIN condition.
You could probably do something like that using CTE's and window function:
WITH    t2o AS
        (
        SELECT  t2.*, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY t1_id ORDER BY rank) AS rn
        FROM    t2
        )
SELECT  t1.*, t2o.*
FROM    t1
INNER JOIN
        t2o
ON      t2o.t1_id = t1.id
        AND t2o.rn <= 3

, but this is less readable and probably less efficient.

master is a table of about 20,000,000 records with a PRIMARY KEY on id.

        (
        SELECT  1 AS id
        UNION ALL
        SELECT  2
        )
SELECT  *
FROM    t
JOIN    q
ON      q.rn <= t.id

runs for almost 30 seconds, while this one:
WITH    t AS 
        (
        SELECT  1 AS id
        UNION ALL
        SELECT  2
        )

is instant.

I have read (vaguely, through posts on the Internet) that cross apply can be more efficient when selecting over large data sets if you are partitioning. (Paging comes to mind)
I also know that CROSS APPLY doesn't require a UDF as the right-table.
In most INNER JOIN queries (one-to-many relationships), I could rewrite them to use CROSS APPLY, but they always give me equivalent execution plans. 
Can anyone give me a good example of when CROSS APPLY makes a difference in those cases where INNER JOIN will work as well?

Edit:
Here's a trivial example, where the execution plans are exactly the same.  (Show me one where they differ and where cross apply is faster/more efficient)

You should always have the new table creation query at hand, and use that for upgrade and transfer any existing data. Note: that the onUpgrade methods runs one for your sqlite helper object and you need to handle all the tables in it.
So what is recommended onUpgrade:

beginTransaction
run a table creation with if not exists (we are doing an upgrade, so the table might not exists yet, it will fail alter and drop)
put in a list the existing columns List<String> columns = DBUtils.GetColumns(db, TableName);
backup table (ALTER table "" + TableName + "" RENAME TO 'temp_""                    + TableName)
create new table (the newest table creation schema)
get the intersection with the new columns, this time columns taken from the upgraded table (columns.retainAll(DBUtils.GetColumns(db, TableName));)
restore data (String cols = StringUtils.join(columns, "","");

remove backup table (DROP table 'temp_"" + TableName)

My database has a table with an items and a favorite column so that the user can favorite an item.  Most implementations I see simply drop the table and reconstruct it but I don't want to do this. I want to be able to add more items to the table.  
When the app is upgraded through the android marketplace does the database know its version number?  So could I increment the version number in the code and then export it to the marketplace and when the user boots up the upgraded version for the first time then onUpgrade will be called?  
If this is the case my onUpgrade would simply pull from a file and add the database items in.  Is this a standard way of doing things or is there a better way of handling this in Android.  I am trying to stay as standard as possible.
Thanks

If you mean concurrent (multi-threaded, multi-core etc.), then I'd say Clojure is the natural solution.

Clojure's STM model is perfectly designed for multi-core concurrency since it is very efficient at storing and managing shared state between threads. If you want to understand more, well worth looking at this excellent video.
Clojure STM allows safe mutation of data by concurrent threads. Erlang sidesteps this problem by making everything immutable, which is fine in itself but doesn't help when you genuinely need shared mutable state. If you want shared mutable state in Erlang, you have to implement it with a set of message interactions which is neither efficient nor convenient (that's the price of a nothing shared model....)
You will get inherently better performance with Clojure if you are in a concurrent setting in a large machine, since Clojure doesn't rely on message passing and hence communication between threads can be much more efficient.

If you mean distributed (i.e. many different machines sharing work over a network which are effectively running as isolated processes) then I'd say Erlang is the more natural solution: 

Erlang's immutable, nothing-shared, message passing style forces you to write code in a way that can be distributed. So idiomatic Erlang automatically can be distributed across multiple machines and run in a distributed, fault-tolerant setting.
Erlang is therefore very well optimised for this use case, so would be the natural choice and would certainly be the quickest to get working.
Clojure could do it as well, but you will need to do much more work yourself (i.e. you'd either need to implement or choose some form of distributed computing framework) - Clojure does not currently come with such a framework by default.

In the long term, I hope that Clojure develops a distributed computing framework that matches Erlang - then you can have the best of both worlds!

To give some background: I'm building a web-app which consists of a large number of card decks which each have a set of individual cards with unique ids. I want users to have a set of 5 cards drawn for them at random from a specific deck.
My plan is to have all of the card ids of a given deck stored as a set in Redis; then I want to use the SPOP function to draw individual cards and remove them from the set so that they are not drawn again within that hand. It would seem to make sense to do this by copying the deck's 'master set' of card IDs into a new temporary set, performing the popping on the copy and then deleting the copied set when I'm done.
But: I can't find any Redis function to command a set copy - the closest thing I can see would be to also create an empty set and then 'join' the empty set and the 'master copy' of the set into a new (if temporary) set with SUNIONSTORE, but that seems hacky. I suppose an alternative would be to copy the set items out into my 'host language' (node.js) and then manually insert the items back into a new Redis set, but this also seems clunky. There's probably a better third option that I haven't even thought of.
Am I doing something wrong - am I not 'getting' Redis, or is the command-set still a bit immature?

The DBAdapter class only gets called when the app first starts and its only responsibility is to create/upgrade the tables.  All other access to the data is done through the individual ""adapter"" class.  I've found that this works perfectly and does not create the versioning issues that I mentioned earlier.
Hope this helps.

When dealing with a multi-table SQLite Database, is it best practice to create a different Adapter Class for each table or create a single DB Adapter class for the entire Android Application?
My application uses multiple tables and I was hoping not to have to have a single massive adapter class.  the problem, however, is that I have a nested subclass of SQLiteOpenHelper per the NotePad Example within each adapter.  When the first table is accessed, everything works fine.  When I then try to access the second tble(from a different activity) my app crashes.
At first, I thought the crash was being caused by a versioning issue, but both adapters now have the same database version and it's still crashing.
Here's an example of one of the DB Adapters for the table.  The other adapters all follow the same format with varying implementations.

When the first adapter, in this case usersinfo, is accessed, everything works as expected.  Let's say I have another adapter for friend info that follows the same structure as above, when it is accessed by a different activity, it would seem to me that the nested subclass of SQLiteOpenHelper would attempt to create the database again.  Obviously something is wrong because in that scenario, my app crashes.
So is the standard practice within Android to create a single mammoth db adapter instead of individual adapters per table?

CString to std::string:
CString cs(""Hello"");
std::string s((LPCTSTR)cs);

BUT: std::string cannot always construct from a LPCTSTR. i.e. the code will fail for UNICODE builds.
As std::string can construct only from LPSTR / LPCSTR, a programmer who uses VC++ 7.x or better can utilize conversion classes such as CT2CA as an intermediary.
CString cs (""Hello"");
// Convert a TCHAR string to a LPCSTR
CT2CA pszConvertedAnsiString (cs);
// construct a std::string using the LPCSTR input
std::string strStd (pszConvertedAnsiString);

std::string to CString: (From Visual Studio's CString FAQs...)
std::string s(""Hello"");
CString cs(s.c_str());

CStringT can construct from both character or wide-character strings. i.e. It can convert from char* (i.e. LPSTR) or from wchar_t* (LPWSTR).
In other words, char-specialization (of CStringT) i.e. CStringA, wchar_t-specilization CStringW, and TCHAR-specialization CString can be constructed from either char or wide-character, null terminated (null-termination is very important here) string sources.
Althoug IInspectable amends the ""null-termination"" part in the comments:

NUL-termination is not required.
CStringT has conversion constructors that take an explicit length argument. This also means that you can construct CStringT objects from std::string objects with embedded NUL characters.

This gives a clear notion of the fields that make the composite key because they are all aggregated in a class that is accessed trough a field access operator.
Another difference with @IdClass and @EmbeddedId is when it comes to write HQL :
With @IdClass you write:
select e.name from Employee e
and with @EmbeddedId you have to write:
select e.employeeId.name from Employee e
You have to write more text for the same query. Some may argue that this differs from a more natural language like the one promoted by IdClass. But most of the times understanding right from the query that a given field is part of the composite key is of invaluable help.

There's actually an example on the Android dev blog that illustrates this concept, and you'll see this in several of the API demos too. Although this specific example is given for API 3.0+ fragments, the same flow applies when using FragmentActivity and Fragment from the support library.
You first retrieve the intent extras as usual in your activity and pass them on as arguments to the fragment:
public static class DetailsActivity extends FragmentActivity {

    @Override
    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);

        // (omitted some other stuff)

        if (savedInstanceState == null) {
            // During initial setup, plug in the details fragment.
            DetailsFragment details = new DetailsFragment();
            details.setArguments(getIntent().getExtras());
            getSupportFragmentManager().beginTransaction().add(
                    android.R.id.content, details).commit();
        }
    }
}

In stead of directly invoking the constructor, it's probably easier to use a static method that plugs the arguments into the fragment for you. Such a method is often called newInstance in the examples given by Google. There actually is a newInstance method in DetailsFragment, so I'm unsure why it isn't used in the snippet above...
Anyways, all extras provided as argument upon creating the fragment, will be available by calling getArguments(). Since this returns a Bundle, its usage is similar to that of the extras in an Activity.
public static class DetailsFragment extends Fragment {
    /**
     * Create a new instance of DetailsFragment, initialized to
     * show the text at 'index'.
     */
    public static DetailsFragment newInstance(int index) {
        DetailsFragment f = new DetailsFragment();

        // Supply index input as an argument.
        Bundle args = new Bundle();
        args.putInt(""index"", index);
        f.setArguments(args);

        return f;
    }

    public int getShownIndex() {
        return getArguments().getInt(""index"", 0);
    }

    // (other stuff omitted)

}

685074,22656.0,2009-03-26 09:34:37+00:00,685060,143,"EDIT: This fails the ""constant space"" constraint - it basically doubles the space required. I very much doubt that there's a solution which doesn't do that though, without wrecking the runtime complexity somewhere (e.g. making push/pop O(n)). Note that this doesn't change the complexity of the space required, e.g. if you've got a stack with O(n) space requirements, this will still be O(n) just with a different constant factor.
Non-constant-space solution
Keep a ""duplicate"" stack of ""minimum of all values lower in the stack"". When you pop the main stack, pop the min stack too. When you push the main stack, push either the new element or the current min, whichever is lower. getMinimum() is then implemented as just minStack.peek().
So using your example, we'd have:
Real stack        Min stack

5  --> TOP        1
1                 1
4                 2
6                 2
2                 2

After popping twice you get:
Real stack        Min stack

4                 2
6                 2
2                 2

Please let me know if this isn't enough information. It's simple when you grok it, but it might take a bit of head-scratching at first :)
(The downside of course is that it doubles the space requirement. Execution time doesn't suffer significantly though - i.e. it's still the same complexity.)
EDIT: There's a variation which is slightly more fiddly, but has better space in general. We still have the min stack, but we only pop from it when the value we pop from the main stack is equal to the one on the min stack. We only push to the min stack when the value being pushed onto the main stack is less than or equal to the current min value. This allows duplicate min values. getMinimum() is still just a peek operation. For example, taking the original version and pushing 1 again, we'd get:
Real stack        Min stack

1  --> TOP        1
5                 1
1                 2
4                 
6                 
2

Popping from the above pops from both stacks because 1 == 1, leaving:
Real stack        Min stack

5  --> TOP        1
1                 2
4                 
6                 
2

Popping again only pops from the main stack, because 5 > 1:
Real stack        Min stack

1                 1
4                 2
6                 
2

Popping again pops both stacks because 1 == 1:
Real stack        Min stack

4                 2
6                 
2

This ends up with the same worst case space complexity (double the original stack) but much better space usage if we rarely get a ""new minimum or equal"".
EDIT: Here's an implementation of Pete's evil scheme. I haven't tested it thoroughly, but I think it's okay :)

For example: consider the below example

case #1

5  --> TOP
1
4
6
2

When getMinimum() is called it should return 1, which is the minimum element 
in the stack. 

case #2

stack.pop()
stack.pop()

Note: Both 5 and 1 are poped out of the stack. So after this, the stack
looks like,

4  --> TOP
6
2

When getMinimum() is called is should return 2 which is the minimum in the 
stack.


Constriants:

getMinimum should return the minimum value in O(1)
Space constraint also has to be considered while designing it and if you use extra space, it should be of constant space.

The smart and innovative folks from TurnKey Linux recently open sourced their solution to your problem, see AWS Regional Data Centers mapping on GitHub:

This project is used to generate the indexes (and visual map for
  reference) used by the TurnKey Hub to find the closest AWS data center
  for a user. [emphasis mine]

The algorithm in use is further detailed in Finding the closest data center using GeoIP and indexing as well as the follow up post Finding the closest APT package archive using GeoIP and indexing.
While a bit of a gimmick, the visualization is seriously cool and confirms resp. illustrates the reason for the at first sight surprising fact Josh mentioned already, namely that users in Australia currently tend to get better latency via the US West (Northern California / us-west-1) rather than the Asia Pacific (Singapore / ap-southeast-1) region. (Tip: checking Future Cables at the bottom right corner reveals this is likely going to change, which is further  detailed in Greg's Cable Map, which indicates Australia might jump between both AWS locations latency wise in the years to come ;)
Using lowest latency AWS location automatically via Amazon Route 53
Meanwhile AWS is providing a helpful map illustrating their Global Infrastructure for a quick assessment, alongside respective details like e.g. number of availability zones and the API endpoint.
More importantly though, AWS has just announced the geographic DNS support Jahufar mentioned already, see the introductory post Multi-Region Latency Based Routing now Available for AWS, which is making available the same latency based routing technology that powers Amazon CloudFront  to users of Amazon EC2, Elastic Load Balancing, and more.
So in case your environment is comprised of an Auto Scaling EC2 Instances architecture already, simply applying this latency based routing should solve your problem automatically.
While the use case obviously targets offerings spawning multiple AWS regions, the sophisticated features around Latency Based Routing and Weighted Round Robin Record Sets might allow you to determine the desired information more easily yourself as well.

The second one sets up a bowl, opens the crate, and then dashes off to get a piece of paper and a pen. He writes the numbers 0 through 11 next to the compartments of the egg carton, and the number 0 on the paper. He looks at the number on the paper, finds the compartment labelled 0, removes the egg and cracks it into the bowl. He looks at the 0 on the paper again, thinks ""0 + 1 = 1"", crosses out the 0 and writes 1 on the paper. He grabs the egg from compartment 1 and cracks it. And so on, until the number 12 is on the paper and he knows (without looking!) that there are no more eggs. A job well done.
You'd think the second guy was a bit messed in the head, right?
The point of working in a high-level language is to avoid having to describe things in a computer's terms, and to be able to describe them in your own terms. The higher-level the language, the more true this is. Incrementing a counter in a loop is a distraction from what you really want to do: process each element.

Further to that, linked-list type structures can't be processed efficiently by incrementing a counter and indexing in: ""indexing"" means starting over counting from the beginning. In C, we can process a linked list that we made ourselves by using a pointer for the loop ""counter"" and dereferencing it. We can do this in modern C++ (and to an extent in C# and Java) using ""iterators"", but this still suffers from the indirectness problem.

Finally, some languages are high-enough level that the idea of actually writing a loop to ""perform an operation on each item in a list"" or ""search for an item in a list"" is appalling (in the same way that the head chef shouldn't have to tell the first kitchen staff member how to ensure that all the eggs are cracked). Functions are provided that set up that loop structure, and you tell them - via a higher-order function, or perhaps a comparison value, in the searching case - what to do within the loop.

The only practical difference between KeyDown and KeyPress is that KeyPress relays the character resulting from a keypress, and is only called if there is one.
In other words, if you press A on your keyboard, you'll get this sequence of events:

KeyDown: KeyCode=Keys.A, KeyData=Keys.A, Modifiers=Keys.None
KeyPress: KeyChar='a'
KeyUp: KeyCode=Keys.A

But if you press Shift+A, you'll get:

KeyDown: KeyCode=Keys.ShiftKey, KeyData=Keys.ShiftKey, Shift, Modifiers=Keys.Shift
KeyDown: KeyCode=Keys.A, KeyData=Keys.A | Keys.Shift, Modifiers=Keys.Shift
KeyPress: KeyChar='A'
KeyUp: KeyCode=Keys.A
KeyUp: KeyCode=Keys.ShiftKey

If you hold down the keys for a while, you'll get something like:

KeyDown: KeyCode=Keys.ShiftKey, KeyData=Keys.ShiftKey, Shift, Modifiers=Keys.Shift
KeyDown: KeyCode=Keys.ShiftKey, KeyData=Keys.ShiftKey, Shift, Modifiers=Keys.Shift
KeyDown: KeyCode=Keys.ShiftKey, KeyData=Keys.ShiftKey, Shift, Modifiers=Keys.Shift
KeyDown: KeyCode=Keys.ShiftKey, KeyData=Keys.ShiftKey, Shift, Modifiers=Keys.Shift
KeyDown: KeyCode=Keys.ShiftKey, KeyData=Keys.ShiftKey, Shift, Modifiers=Keys.Shift
KeyDown: KeyCode=Keys.A, KeyData=Keys.A | Keys.Shift, Modifiers=Keys.Shift
KeyPress: KeyChar='A'
KeyDown: KeyCode=Keys.A, KeyData=Keys.A | Keys.Shift, Modifiers=Keys.Shift
KeyPress: KeyChar='A'
KeyDown: KeyCode=Keys.A, KeyData=Keys.A | Keys.Shift, Modifiers=Keys.Shift
KeyPress: KeyChar='A'
KeyDown: KeyCode=Keys.A, KeyData=Keys.A | Keys.Shift, Modifiers=Keys.Shift
KeyPress: KeyChar='A'
KeyDown: KeyCode=Keys.A, KeyData=Keys.A | Keys.Shift, Modifiers=Keys.Shift
KeyPress: KeyChar='A'
KeyUp: KeyCode=Keys.A
KeyUp: KeyCode=Keys.ShiftKey

Notice that KeyPress occurs in between KeyDown and KeyUp, not after KeyUp, as many of the other answers have stated, that KeyPress is not called when a character isn't generated, and that KeyDown is repeated while the key is held down, also contrary to many of the other answers.
Examples of keys that do not directly result in calls to KeyPress:

Shift, Ctrl, Alt
F1 through F12
Arrow keys

Examples of keys that do result in calls to KeyPress:

A through Z, 0 through 9, etc.
Spacebar
Tab (KeyChar='\t', ASCII 9)
Enter (KeyChar='\r', ASCII 13)
Esc (KeyChar='\x1b', ASCII 27)
Backspace (KeyChar='\b', ASCII 8)

For the curious, KeyDown roughly correlates to WM_KEYDOWN, KeyPress to WM_CHAR, and KeyUp to WM_KEYUP.  WM_KEYDOWN can be called fewer than the the number of key repeats, but it sends a repeat count, which, IIRC, WinForms uses to generate exactly one KeyDown per repeat.

The only way to do that is to send them an email and have them click a link to verify.
Therefore, a most basic check (e.g. that they didn't accidentally entered their street address) is usually enough. Something like: it has exactly one @ sign, and at least one . in the part after the @:
[^@]+@[^@]+\.[^@]+

You'd probably also want to disallow whitespace -- there are probably valid email addresses with whitespace in them, but I've never seen one, so the odds of this being a user error are on your side.
If you want the full check, have a look at this question.

Update: Here's how you could use any such regex:
import re

if not re.match(r""... regex here ..."", email):
  # whatever

Note the r in front of the string; this way, you won't need to escape things twice.
If you have a large number of regexes to check, it might be faster to compile the regex first:

lapply returns a list of the same length as X, each element of which is the result of applying FUN to the corresponding element of X.
do.call constructs and executes a function call from a name or a function and a list of arguments to be passed to it.
Map applies a function to the corresponding elements of given vectors... Map is a simple wrapper to mapply which does not attempt to simplify the result, similar to Common Lisp's mapcar (with arguments being recycled, however). Future versions may allow some control of the result type.



Map is a wrapper around mapply
lapply is a special case of mapply
Therefore Map and lapply will be similar in many cases.

For example, here is lapply:
lapply(iris, class)
$Sepal.Length
[1] ""numeric""

$Sepal.Width
[1] ""numeric""

$Petal.Length
[1] ""numeric""

$Petal.Width
[1] ""numeric""

$Species
[1] ""factor""

And the same using Map:
Map(class, iris)
$Sepal.Length
[1] ""numeric""

$Sepal.Width
[1] ""numeric""

$Petal.Length
[1] ""numeric""

$Petal.Width
[1] ""numeric""

$Species
[1] ""factor""


do.call takes a function as input and splatters its other arguments to the function. It is widely used, for example, to assemble lists into simpler structures (often with rbind or cbind).
For example:
x <- lapply(iris, class)

Use the ICU library.

First you have to answer a question: What is the encoding of your std::string? Is it ISO-8859-1? Or perhaps ISO-8859-8? Or Windows Codepage 1252? Does whatever you're using to convert upper-to-lowercase know that? (Or does it fail miserably for characters over 0x7f?)
If you are using UTF-8 (the only sane choice among the 8-bit encodings) with std::string as container, you are already deceiving yourself into believing that you are still in control of things, because you are storing a multibyte character sequence in a container that is not aware of the multibyte concept. Even something as simple as .length() is lying to you, and .substr() is a ticking timebomb. (Because splitting a multibyte sequence will result in an invalid (sub-) string.)
And as soon as you try something like std::toupper( 'Ã' ), in any encoding, you are in deep trouble. (Because it's simply not possible to do this ""right"" with the standard library, which can only deliver one result character, not the ""SS"" needed here.) Another example would be std::tolower( 'I' ), which should yield different results depending on the locale. In Germany, 'i' would be correct; in Turkey, 'Ä±' (LATIN SMALL LETTER DOTLESS I) is the expected result.
Then there is the point that the standard library is depending on which locales are supported on the machine your software is running on... and what do you do if it isn't?
So what you are really looking for is a string class that is capable of dealing with all this correctly, and that is not std::string.
(C++11 note: std::u16string and std::u32string are better, but still not perfect.)
While Boost looks nice, API wise, Boost.Locale is basically a wrapper around ICU. If Boost is compiled with ICU support... if it isn't, Boost.Locale is limited to the locale support compiled for the standard library.
And believe me, getting Boost to compile with ICU can be a real pain sometimes. (There are no pre-compiled binaries for Windows, so you'd have to supply them together with your application, and that opens a whole new can of worms...)
So personally I would recommend getting full Unicode support straight from the horse's mouth and using the ICU library directly:
#include <unicode/unistr.h>
#include <unicode/ustream.h>
#include <unicode/locid.h>

#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    char const * someString = ""Eidenges\xe4\xdf"";
    icu::UnicodeString someUString( someString, ""ISO-8859-1"" );
    std::cout << someUString.toLower( ""de_DE"" ) << ""\n"";
    std::cout << someUString.toUpper( ""de_DE"" ) << ""\n"";
    return 0;
}

Compile (with G++ in this example):
g++ -Wall example.cpp -licuuc -licuio

This gives:

Since float and double are not of integral or enumeration type, such members must either be constexpr, or non-static in order for the initializer in the class definition to be permitted.

error: âconstexprâ needed for in-class initialization of static data member âtoleranceâ of non-integral type

I know I can define and initialize this static const member outside of the class definition. Also, a non-static constant data member can be initialized in the initializer list of a constructor.
But is there any way to initialize a constant within class declaration just like it is possible in PHP or C#?
Update
I used static keyword just because it was possible to initialize such constants within the class declaration in g++. I just need a way to initialize a constant in a class declaration no matter if it declared as static or not.

Next, Wikipedia has a moderately helpful section on Objective-C protocols. In particular, understand that Objective-C supports both formal protocols (which are explicitly declared with the @protocol keyword, the equivalent of a Java interface) and informal protocols (just one or more methods implemented by a class, which can be discovered via reflection).
If you adopt a formal protocol (Objective-C terminology for ""implement an interface"") the compiler will emit warnings for unimplemented methods, just as you would expect in Java. Unlike Java (as skaffman mentioned), if an Objective-C class implements the methods contained in a formal protocol, it is said to ""conform"" to that protocol, even if its interface doesn't explicitly adopt it. You can test protocol conformance in code (using -conformsToProtocol:) like this:
if ([myObject conformsToProtocol:@protocol(MyProtocol)]) {
    ...
}

NOTE: Apple's documentation states:

""This method determines conformance solely on the basis of the formal declarations in header files, as illustrated above. It doesnât check to see whether the methods declared in the protocol are actually implementedâthatâs the programmerâs responsibility.""

As of Objective-C 2.0 (in OS X 10.5 ""Leopard"" and iOS), formal protocols can now define optional methods, andÂ a class conforms to a protocol as long as it implements all the required methods. You can use the @required (default) and @optional keywords to toggle whether the method declarations that follow must or may be implemented to conform to the protocol. (See the section of Apple's Objective-C 2.0 Programming Language guide that discusses optional protocol methods.)
Optional protocol methods open up a lot of flexibility to developers, particularly for implementing delegates and listeners. Instead of extending something like a MouseInputAdapter (which can be annoying, since Java is also single-inheritance) or implementing a lot of pointless, empty methods, you can adopt a protocol and implement only the optional methods you care about. With this pattern, the caller checks whether the method is implemented before invoking it (using -respondsToSelector) like so:
if ([myObject respondsToSelector:@selector(fillArray:withObject:)]) {
    [myObject fillArray:anArray withObject:foo];
    ...
}

If the overhead of reflection becomes a problem, you can always cache the boolean result for reuse, but resist the urge to optimize prematurely.  :-)

I can speak a bit more to the differences between PhoneGap and Xamarin, as I work with these two 5 (or more) days a week.
If you are already familiar with C# and JavaScript, then the question I guess is, does the business logic lie in an area more suited to JavaScript or C#?
PhoneGap
PhoneGap is designed to allow you to write your applications using JavaScript and HTML, and much of the functionality that they do provide is designed to mimic the current proposed specifications for the functionality that will eventually be available with HTML5. The big benefit of PhoneGap in my opinion is that since you are doing the UI with HTML, it can easily be ported between platforms. The downside is, because you are porting the same UI between platforms, it won't feel quite as at home in any of them. Meaning that, without further tweaking, you can't have an application that feels fully at home in iOS and Android, meaning that it has the iOS and Android styling. The majority of your logic can be written using JavaScript, which means it too can be ported between platforms. If the current PhoneGap API does most of what you want, then it's pretty easy to get up and running. If however, there are things you need from the device that are not in the API, then you get into the fun of Plugin Development, which will be in the native device's development language of choice (with one caveat, but I'll get to that), which means you would likely need to get up to speed quickly in Objective-C, Java, etc. The good thing about this model, is you can usually adapt many different native libraries to serve your purpose, and many libraries already have PhoneGap Plugins. Although you might not have much experience with these languages, there will at least be a plethora of examples to work from.
Xamarin
Xamarin.iOS and Xamarin.Android (also known as MonoTouch and MonoDroid), are designed to allow you to have one library of business logic, and use this within your application, and hook it into your UI. Because it's based on .NET 4.5, you get some awesome lambda notations, LINQ, and a whole bunch of other C# awesomeness, which can make writing your business logic less painful. The downside here is that Xamarin expects that you want to make your applications truly feel native on the device, which means that you will likely end up rewriting your UI for each platform, before hooking it together with the business logic. I have heard about MvvmCross, which is designed to make this easier for you, but I haven't really had an opportunity to look into it yet. If you are familiar with the MVVM system in C#, you may want to have a look at this. When it comes to native libraries, MonoTouch becomes interesting. MonoTouch requires a Binding library to tell your C# code how to link into the underlying Objective-C and Java code. Some of these libraries will already have bindings, but if yours doesn't, creating one can be, interesting. Xamarin has made a tool called Objective Sharpie to help with this process, and for the most part, it will get you 95% of the way there. The remaining 5% will probably take 80% of your time attempting to bind a library.
Update
As noted in the comments below, Xamarin has released Xamarin Forms which is a cross platform abstraction around the platform specific UI components. Definitely worth the look. 
PhoneGap / Xamarin Hybrid
Now because I said I would get to it, the caveat mentioned in PhoneGap above, is a Hybrid approach, where you can use PhoneGap for part, and Xamarin for part. I have quite a bit of experience with this, and I would caution you against it. Highly. The problem with this, is it is such a no mans' land that if you ever run into issues, almost no one will have come close to what you're doing, and will question what you're trying to do greatly. It is doable, but it's definitely not fun.
Appcelerator Titanium
As I mentioned before, I haven't worked much with Appcelerator Titanium, So for the differences between them, I will suggest you look at Comparing Titanium and Phonegap or Comparison between Corona, Phonegap, Titanium as it has a very thorough description of the differences. Basically, it appears that though they both use JavaScript, how that JavaScript is interpreted is slightly different. With Titanium, you will be writing your JavaScript to the Titanium SDK, whereas with PhoneGap, you will write your application using the PhoneGap API. As PhoneGap is very HTML5 and JavaScript standards compliant, you can use pretty much any JavaScript libraries you want, such as JQuery. With PhoneGap your user interface will be composed of HTML and CSS. With Titanium, you will benefit from their Cross-platform XML which appears to generate Native components. This means it will definitely have a better native look and feel.

Probably the most common use case: Grouping items (in unsorted data, else use itertools.groupby)
# really verbose
new = {}
for (key, value) in data:
    if key in new:
        new[key].append( value )

# even simpler with defaultdict 
new = defaultdict(list)
for (key, value) in data:
    new[key].append( value ) # all keys have a default already

Sometimes you want to make sure that specific keys exist after creating a dict. defaultdict doesn't work in this case, because it only creates keys on explicit access. Think you use something HTTP-ish with many headers -- some are optional, but you want defaults for them:
headers = parse_headers( msg ) # parse the message, get a dict
# now add all the optional headers
for headername, defaultvalue in optional_headers:
    headers.setdefault( headername, defaultvalue )

    VeryLongConditionMethod(c))

If they're even more complicated, then I'd consider doing the condition methods seperately outside the if statment
bool aa = FirstVeryLongConditionMethod(a) && SecondVeryLongConditionMethod(a);
bool bb = FirstVeryLongConditionMethod(b) && SecondVeryLongConditionMethod(b);

The main difference is that the markup of formtastic is fixed. Mind you: if you don't mind, it is fantastic. It is really awesome to get started with. Also it comes with a default css, so your forms will look good straight out of the box.
The advantage of simple_form over formtastic is that you can modify the markup to your needs. This can be handy if your designer likes your fields to be grouped inside div instead of li. The downside of simple_form is that it doesn't come with any standard layout (css). That makes formtastic much easier to start off with. Because the API is nearly identical, if needed, you can very easily switch to simple_form if needed.

",3511120,213269.0,2010-08-18 10:33:04+00:00,,67,Why shouldn't I use immutable POJOs instead of JavaBeans?,"I have implemented a few Java applications now, only desktop applications so far. I prefer to use immutable objects for passing the data around in the application instead of using objects with mutators (setters and getters), also called JavaBeans.
But in the Java world, it seems to be much more common to use JavaBeans, and I can't understand why I should use them instead. Personally the code looks better if it only deals with immutable objects instead of mutate the state all the time. 
Immutable objects are also recommended in Item 15: Minimize mutability, Effective Java 2ed.
If I have an object Person implemented as a JavaBean it would look like:
public class Person {
    private String name;
    private Place birthPlace;

    public Person() {}

    public setName(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    public setBirthPlace(Place birthPlace) {
        this.birthPlace = birthPlace;
    }

    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    public Place getBirthPlace() {
        return birthPlace;
    }
}

And the same Person implemented as an immutable object:
public class Person {
    private final String name;
    private final Place birthPlace;

    public Person(String name, Place birthPlace) {
        this.name = name;
        this.birthPlace = birthPlace;
    }

    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    public Place getBirthPlace() {
        return birthPlace;
    }
}

Or closer to an struct in C:
public class Person {
    public final String name;
    public final Place birthPlace;

    public Person(String name, Place birthPlace) {
        this.name = name;
        this.birthPlace = birthPlace;
    }
}

I could also have getters in the immutable object to hide the implementation details. But since I only use it as a struct I prefer to skip the ""getters"", and keep it simple.
Simply, I don't understand why it's better to use JavaBeans, or if I can and should keep going with my immutable POJOs?
Many of the Java libraries seem to have better support for JavaBeans, but maybe more support for immutable POJOs gets more popular over time?

This adds a UIRefreshControl above your table view and works as expected without having to use a UITableViewController :)

EDIT: This above still works but as a few have pointed out, there is a slight ""stutter"" when adding the UIRefreshControl in this manner. A solution to that is to instantiate a UITableViewController, and then setting your UIRefreshControl and UITableView to that, i.e.:
UITableViewController *tableViewController = [[UITableViewController alloc] init];
tableViewController.tableView = self.myTableView;

self.refreshControl = [[UIRefreshControl alloc] init];

Varnish is in front of the webserver; it works as a reverse http proxy that caches.
You can use both.
Mostly write -- Varnish will need to have affected pages purged. This will result in an overhead and little benefit for modified pages.
Mostly read -- Varnish will probably cover most of it.
Similar read & write -- Varnish will serve a lot of the pages for you, Memcache will provide info for pages that have a mixture of known and new data allowing you to generate pages faster.

An example that could apply to stackoverflow.com: adding this comment invalidated the page cache, so this page would have to be cleared from Varnish (and also my profile page, which probably isn't worth caching to begin with. Remembering to invalidate all affected pages may be a bit of an issue). All the comments, however, are still in Memcache, so the database only has to write this comment. Nothing else needs to be done by the database to generate the page. All the comments are pulled by Memcache, and the page is recached until somebody affects it again (perhaps by voting my answer up). Again, the database writes the vote, all other data is pulled from Memcache, and life is fast.
Memcache saves your DB from doing a lot of read work, Varnish saves your dynamic web server from CPU load by making you generate pages less frequently (and lightens the db load a bit as well if not for Memcache).

On the other side, Memcached is general purpose caching system and mostly used to cache result from database and does require change in get method (first cache lookup).

NoClassDefFoundError can occur for multiple reasons like

Class file located, but Exception raised while initializing static variables
Class file located, Exception raised while initializing static blocks 

In the original question, it was the first case which can be corrected by setting CLASSPATH to the referenced classes jar file or to its package folder. 
What it means by saying ""available in compile time""? 

The referenced class is used in the code.    Eg: Two classes, A
and B(extends A). If B is referenced directly in the code, it is
available at compile time, i.e. A a = new B();

What it means by saying ""not available at compile time""?

The compile time class and runtime class are different, i.e. for example base class is loaded using classname of child class for example

As far as I know, using 'rU' mode would mess you up if there are embedded \r in the data, but not cause any other dramas. I also note that you have several files (all opened with 'rU' ??) but only one causing a problem.
If the csv module says that you have a ""NULL"" (silly message, should be ""NUL"") byte in your file, then you need to check out what is in your file. I would suggest that you do this even if using 'rb' makes the problem go away.
repr() is (or wants to be) your debugging friend. It will show unambiguously what you've got, in a platform independant fashion (which is helpful to helpers who are unaware what od is or does). Do this:
print repr(open('my.csv', 'rb').read(200)) # dump 1st 200 bytes of file

and carefully copy/paste (don't retype) the result into an edit of your question (not into a comment).
Also note that if the file is really dodgy e.g. no \r or \n within reasonable distance from the start of the file, the line number reported by reader.line_num will be (unhelpfully) 1. Find where the first \x00 is (if any) by doing
data = open('my.csv', 'rb').read()
print data.find('\x00')

and make sure that you dump at least that many bytes with repr or od.
What does data.count('\x00') tell you? If there are many, you may want to do something like
for i, c in enumerate(data):
    if c == '\x00':
        print i, repr(data[i-30:i]) + ' *NUL* ' + repr(data[i+1:i+31])

so that you can see the NUL bytes in context.
If you can see \x00 in the output (or \0 in your od -c output), then you definitely have NUL byte(s) in the file, and you will need to do something like this:
fi = open('my.csv', 'rb')
data = fi.read()
fi.close()
fo = open('mynew.csv', 'wb')
fo.write(data.replace('\x00', ''))
fo.close()

By the way, have you looked at the file (including the last few lines) with a text editor? Does it actually look like a reasonable CSV file like the other (no ""NULL byte"" exception) files?

    sys.exit('file %s, line %d: %s' % (filename, reader.line_num, e))

What can I do? Google seems to suggest that it may be an Excel file that's been saved as a .csv improperly. Is there any way I can get round this problem in Python?

Following @JohnMachin's comment below, I tried adding these lines to my script: 
print repr(open(filepath, 'rb').read(200)) # dump 1st 200 bytes of file
data = open(filepath, 'rb').read()

If you've got a string, and you expect it to always be an integer (say, if some web service is handing you an integer in string format), you'd use Int32.Parse().  
If you're collecting input from a user, you'd generally use Int32.TryParse(), since it allows you more fine-grained control over the situation when the user enters in invalid input. 
Convert.ToInt32() takes an object as its argument, and I believe it invokes Int32.TryParse() when it finds that the object taken as the argument is a string.  
Convert.ToInt32() also does not throw ArgumentNullException when it's argument is null the way Int32.Parse() does. That also means that Convert.ToInt32() is probably a wee bit slower than Int32.Parse(), though in practice, unless you're doing a very large number of iterations in a loop, you'll never notice it.

310914,19468.0,2008-11-22 05:26:52+00:00,310870,376,"The examples have very different outcomes.
Before looking at the differences, the following should be noted:

A constructor's prototype provides a way to share methods and values among instances via the instance's private [[Prototype]] property.
A function's this is set by how the function is called or by the use of bind (not discussed here). Where a function is called on an object (e.g. myObj.method()) then this within the method references the object. Where this is not set by the call or by the use of bind, it defaults to the global object (window in a browser) or in strict mode, remains undefined.
JavaScript is a object oriented language, i.e. everything is an Object, including functions.

So here are the snippets in question:
var A = function () {
    this.x = function () {
        //do something
    };
};

In this case, variable A is assigned a value that is a reference to a function.  When that function is called using A(), the function's this isn't set by the call so it defaults to the global object and the expression this.x is effectively window.x. The result is that a reference to the function expression on the right hand side is assigned to window.x.
In the case of:
var A = function () { };
A.prototype.x = function () {
    //do something
};

something very different occurs.  In the first line, variable A is assigned a reference to a function.  In JavaScript, all functions objects have a prototype property by default so there is no separate code to create an A.prototype object.
In the second line, A.prototype.x is assigned a reference to a function. This will create an x property if it doesn't exist, or assign a new value if it does. So the difference with the first example is which object's x property is involved in the expression.
Another example is below.  It's similar to the first one (and may be what you meant to ask about):
var A = new function () {
    this.x = function () {
        //do something
    };
};

In this example, the new operator has been added before the function expression so that the function is called as a constructor. When called with new, the function's this is set to reference a new Object whose private [[Prototype]] property is set to reference the constructor's public prototype. So in the assignment statement, the x property will be created on this new object. When called as a constructor, a function returns its this object by default, so there is no need for a separate return this; statement.
To check that A has an x property:
console.log(A.x) // function () {
                 //   //do something
                 // };

This is an uncommon use of new, since the only way to reference the constructor is via A.constructor. It would be much more common to do:
var A = function () {
    this.x = function () {
        //do something
    };
};
var a = new A();

Another way of achieving a similar result is to use an immediately invoked function expression:
var A = (function () {
    this.x = function () {
        //do something
    };
}());

In this case, A assigned the return value of calling the function on the right hand side. Here again, since this is not set in the call, it will reference the global object and this.x is effectively window.x. Since the function doesn't return anything, A will have a value of undefined.
These differences between the two approaches also manifest if you're serializing and de-serializing your Javascript objects to/from JSON. Methods defined on an object's prototype are not serialized when you serialize the object, which can be convenient when for example you want to serialize just the data portions of an object, but not it's methods:
var A = function () { 
    this.objectsOwnProperties = ""are serialized"";
};
A.prototype.prototypeProperties = ""are NOT serialized"";
var instance = new A();
console.log(instance.prototypeProperties); // ""are NOT serialized""
console.log(JSON.stringify(instance)); 
// {""objectsOwnProperties"":""are serialized""}

What does it mean that JavaScript is a prototypal language?
What is the scope of a function in JavaScript?
How does the ""this"" keyword work?

Sidenote: There may not be any significant memory savings between the two approaches, however using the prototype to share methods and properties will likely use less memory than each instance having its own copy.
JavaScript isn't a low-level language.  It may not be very valuable to think of prototyping or other inheritance patterns as a way to explicitly change the way memory is allocated.

585897,22656.0,2009-02-25 13:00:58+00:00,585860,58,"Short answer: it depends.
Long answer: if you already have an array of strings to concatenate together (with a delimiter), String.Join is the fastest way of doing it.
String.Join can look through all of the strings to work out the exact length it needs, then go again and copy all the data. This means there will be no extra copying involved. The only downside is that it has to go through the strings twice, which means potentially blowing the memory cache more times than necessary.
If you don't have the strings as an array beforehand, it's probably faster to use StringBuilder - but there will be situations where it isn't. If using a StringBuilder means doing lots and lots of copies, then building an array and then calling String.Join may well be faster.
EDIT: This is in terms of a single call to String.Join vs a bunch of calls to StringBuilder.Append. In the original question, we had two different levels of String.Join calls, so each of the nested calls would have created an intermediate string. In other words, it's even more complex and harder to guess about. I would be surprised to see either way ""win"" significantly (in complexity terms) with typical data.
EDIT: When I'm at home, I'll write up a benchmark which is as painful as possibly for StringBuilder. Basically if you have an array where each element is about twice the size of the previous one, and you get it just right, you should be able to force a copy for every append (of elements, not of the delimiter, although that needs to be taken into account too). At that point it's nearly as bad as simple string concatenation - but String.Join will have no problems.

Both use arrays for storage, but ToList has a more flexible constraint.  It needs the array to be at least as large as the number of elements in the collection.  If the array is larger, that is not a problem.  However ToArray needs the array to be sized exactly to the number of elements.
To meet this constraint ToArray often does one more allocation than ToList.  Once it has an array that is big enough it allocates an array which is exactly the correct size and copies the elements back into that array.  The only time it can avoid this is when the grow algorithm for the array just happens to coincide with the number of elements needing to be stored (definitely in the minority).  
EDIT
A couple of people have asked me about the consequence of having the extra unused memory in the List<T> value.  
This is a valid concern.  If the created collection is long lived, is never modified after being created and has a high chance of landing in the Gen2 heap then you may be better off taking the extra allocation of ToArray up front.  
In general though I find this to be the rarer case.  It's much more common to see a lot of ToArray calls which are immediately passed to other short lived uses of memory in which case ToList is demonstrably better.  
The key here is to profile, profile and then profile some more.

This works fine. But if I am not going to modify the result, then I might as well call ToArray() instead of ToList().
I wonder however whether ToArray() is implemented by first calling ToList() and is therefore less memory efficient than just calling ToList().
Am I crazy? Should I just call ToArray() - safe and secure in the knowledge that the memory won't be allocated twice?

24046893,390581.0,2014-06-04 20:23:09+00:00,24045890,105,"Update for Swift 2.0: Now functions behave identically to methods, and for both, by default:

the first parameter has no external name; and
the other parameters have an external name identical to the internal name.

Other than that, the rules below still apply, except that the # shorthand syntax is now gone.

Here's a more general answer: functions behave differently when defined as true functions outside a class, and when defined as methods. Moreover, init methods have a special rule.

Functions
Suppose you define this:
func multiply1(f1: Double, f2: Double) -> Double {
    return f1 * f2
}

Parameter names are here only local to the function, and cannot be used when calling the function:
multiply1(10.0, 10.0)

If you want to force using named parameters when calling the function, you can. Prefix each parameter declaration with its external name. Here, the external name of f1 is f1param, and for f2, we use the shorthand where we prefix it by # to indicate that the local name is to be used as the external name as well:
func multiply2(f1param f1: Double, #f2: Double) -> Double {
    return f1 * f2
}

Then, named parameters must be used:
multiply2(f1param: 10.0, f2: 10.0)


Methods
Things are different for methods. By default, all but the first parameter are named, as you've discovered. Suppose we have this, and consider the multiply1 method:
class Calc {
    func multiply1(f1: Double, f2: Double) -> Double {
        return f1 * f2
    }
    func multiply2(f1param f1: Double, f2: Double) -> Double {
        return f1 * f2
    }
    func multiply3(f1: Double, _ f2: Double) -> Double {
        return f1 * f2
    }
}

Then, you have to use the name of the second (and following, if any) parameters:
let calc = Calc()
calc.multiply1(1.0, f2: 10.0)

You can force to use a named param for the first argument by providing an external name for it, like for functions (or prefixing its local name with # if you want to use the same external name as its local name). Then, you have to use it:
calc.multiply2(f1param: 10.0, f2: 10.0)

Finally, you can declare an external name of _ for the other following arguments, indicating that you want to call your method without using named parameters, like this:
calc.multiply3(10.0, 10.0)

Interoperability note: If you prefix class Calc with the @objc annotation, then you can use it from Objective-C code, and it is equivalent to this declaration (look at parameter names):
@interface Calc
- (double)multiply1:(double)f1 f2:(double)f2;
- (double)multiply2WithF1param:(double)f1 f2:(double)f2;
- (double)multiply3:(double)f1 :(double)f2;
@end


Init Methods
The rule differs a bit for init methods, where all parameters have an external name by default. For instance, this works:
class Calc {
    init(start: Int) {}
    init(_ start: String) {}
}

let c1 = Calc(start: 6)
let c2 = Calc(""6"")

Here, you have to specify start: for the overload that accepts an Int, but you must omit it for the overload that accepts a String.
Interoperability note: this class would get exported to Objective-C like this:
@interface Calc
- (instancetype)initWithStart:(NSInteger)start __attribute__((objc_designated_initializer));
- (instancetype)init:(NSString *)start __attribute__((objc_designated_initializer));
@end


Closures
Assume you define a closure type like this:
typealias FancyFunction = (f1: Double, f2: Double) -> Double

The parameter names will behave very similar to those in a method.  You will have to provide the names to the parameters when calling the closure unless you explicitly set the external name to _.
For example, executing the closure:
fund doSomethingInteresting(withFunction: FancyFunction) {
    withFunction(f1: 1.0, f2: 3.0)
}


As a rule of thumb: even if you dislike them, you should probably try to keep using named parameters at least whenever two parameters have the same type, in order to disambiguate them. I'd also argue that it's good to also name at least all Int and Boolean parameters.

var multResult = calculator.multiply(9834, 2321)

The problem is that the compiler wants it to look more like this:
var multResult = calculator.multiply(9834, factor2: 2321)

Why does the first one cause an error?

^ matches the start of the line.

/^(7|8|9)\d{9}$/
/^[789]\d{9}$/
/^[7-9]\d{9}$/

The reason is:
(a|b|c) is a regex ""OR"" and means ""a or b or c"", although the presence of brackets,  necessary for the OR, also captures the digit. To be strictly equivalent, you would code (?:7|8|9) to make it a non capturing group.
[abc] is a ""character class"" that means ""any character from a,b or c"" (a characer class may use ranges, eg [a-d] = [abcd])
The reason these regexes are similar is that a character class is a shorthand for an ""or"" (but only for single characters). In an alternation, you can also do something like (abc|def) which does not translate to a character class.

With the latest version of Lumen (5.2) the Microframework focuses on Stateless APIs.
The documentation states:

Lumen 5.2 represents a shift on slimming Lumen to focus solely on serving stateless, JSON APIs. As such, sessions and views are no longer included with the framework. If you need access to these features, you should use the full Laravel framework.


Original answer (<= 5.1)
Lumen is all about speed. It's faster and can handle more requests per second than Laravel.
Laravel is a framework that glues together a lot of components (3rd party and Laravels own components). Now Lumen makes use of a lot of the same components, but strips down the bootstrapping process to a minimum. You could say it is a ""different glue"", the components (and therefore a lot of the features) are mostly the same.
The performance improvement is achieved by taking away some of the flexibility of the framework in terms of configuration and altering the default boot process.  
Besides that, more features are disabled by default and have to be activated before they can be used. As an example: Facades (like DB::table())
You first need to uncomment this line in bootstrap/app.php to enable them:
// $app->withFacades();

The same goes for Dotenv environment files and Eloquent.
For routing Lumen uses nikic/FastRoute instead of symfonys router because it performs a lot better and gives the micro-framework another big boost.
Other than that pretty much everything is the same as in Laravel.

Now the MenuItem is state dependent.  It's a Pause/Resume menu option for pausing and resuming a queue.  My problem is I can't figure out how to set it's initial statue when the Fragment is created.
It's state is dependent on the whether the queue is paused or not.  So I have an AsyncTask that gets the queue and sets a boolean (paused) based on the state of the queue.  I'm calling onPrepareOptionsMenu to set the text for the Pause menu item based on the last known state of the queue and this works great if I leave the MenuItem in the actual menu.  You tap the menu icon and onPrepareOptionsMenu is fired and the menu is updated before it's displayed.  
The problem is, if I put that same MenuItem on the ActionBar (showAsAction), how can I force it to update without having to call onPrepareOptionsMenu?  I need to be able to do this because on first launch of the app, I send a request to get the queue, but the task returns after the ActionBar is setup and displayed.  I've created a handler in my fragment that gets called every time I get a queue update, but from there, how can I update the text for my MenuItem on the ActionBar?  I can't seem to find a way to get the currently set Menu to manipulate it except for in onPrepareOptionMenu.

If you don't know where the eclipse.ini file is: regularly it is in the folder of your eclipse.exe. 
Edit2: @KadoLakatt: the reason why installing the latest Java Version worked for you is because Eclipse checks the standard path for a JVM if it doesn't find a -vm entry (see here). However I'd not recommend that, since you might be wrong guessing the JVM used. If you update Java (automatically?) you might run into problems in your Eclipse wondering what you might have changed.

I'm trying to improve the maintainability of some code involving reflection. The app has a .NET Remoting interface exposing (among other things) a method called Execute for accessing parts of the app not included in its published remote interface. 
Here is how the app designates properties (a static one in this example) which are meant to be accessible via Execute:
RemoteMgr.ExposeProperty(""SomeSecret"", typeof(SomeClass), ""SomeProperty"");

So a remote user could call: 
string response = remoteObject.Execute(""SomeSecret"");

and the app would use reflection to find SomeClass.SomeProperty and return its value as a string.
Unfortunately, if someone renames SomeProperty and forgets to change the 3rd parm of ExposeProperty(), it breaks this mechanism.
I need to the equivalent of: 
SomeClass.SomeProperty.GetTheNameOfThisPropertyAsAString()

to use as the 3rd parm in ExposeProperty so refactoring tools would take care of renames.
Is there a way to do this? Thanks in advance.
Okay, here's what I ended up creating (based upon the answer I selected and the question he referenced):
// <summary>
// Get the name of a static or instance property from a property access lambda.
// </summary>
// <typeparam name=""T"">Type of the property</typeparam>
// <param name=""propertyLambda"">lambda expression of the form: '() => Class.Property' or '() => object.Property'</param>
// <returns>The name of the property</returns>
public string GetPropertyName<T>(Expression<Func<T>> propertyLambda)
{
    var me = propertyLambda.Body as MemberExpression;

    if (me == null)
    {
        throw new ArgumentException(""You must pass a lambda of the form: '() => Class.Property' or '() => object.Property'"");
    }

    return me.Member.Name;
 }

Usage:
// Static Property
string name = GetPropertyName(() => SomeClass.SomeProperty);

// Instance Property
string name = GetPropertyName(() => someObject.SomeProperty);

Now with this cool capability, it's time to simplify the ExposeProperty method. Polishing doorknobs is dangerous work...

2147361,69326.0,2010-01-27 13:57:39+00:00,2137320,66,"There are various approaches to JavaScript execution, even when doing JIT. V8 and Nitro (formerly known as SquirrelFish Extreme) choose to do a whole-method JIT, meaning that they compile all JavaScript code down to native instructions when they encounter script, and then simply execute that as if it was compiled C code. SpiderMonkey uses a ""tracing"" JIT instead, which first compiles the script to bytecode and interprets it, but monitors the execution, looking for ""hot spots"" such as loops. When it detects one, it then compiles just that hot path to machine code and executes that in the future.
Both approaches have upsides and downsides. Whole-method JIT ensures that all JavaScript that is executed will be compiled and run as machine code and not interpreted, which in general should be faster. However, depending on the implementation it may mean that the engine spends time compiling code that will never be executed, or may only be executed once, and is not performance critical. In addition, this compiled code must be stored in memory, so this can lead to higher memory usage.
The tracing JIT as implemented in SpiderMonkey can produce extremely specialized code compared to a whole-method JIT, since it has already executed the code and can speculate on the types of variables (such as treating the index variable in a for loop as a native integer), where a whole-method JIT would have to treat the variable as an object because JavaScript is untyped and the type could change (SpiderMonkey will simply ""fall off"" trace if the assumption fails, and return to interpreting bytecode). However, SpiderMonkey's tracing JIT currently does not work efficiently on code with many branches, as the traces are optimized for single paths of execution. In addition, there's some overhead involved in monitoring execution before deciding to compile a trace, and then switching execution to that trace. Also, if the tracer makes an assumption that is later violated (such as a variable changing type), the cost of falling off trace and switching back to interpreting is likely to be higher than with a whole-method JIT.

Edit: OK, it's fair enough to say my response warrants a little more info. 
I'd choose MVC for the following reasons:

I have worked in Rails and found it highly productive. ASP MVC has borrowed so much from Rails that it feels like a direct port in some ways (and that's a good thing in my mind).
AJAX is important, but I hate the Microsoft ""Atlas"" approach to AJAX (whatever the product name is these days). If you're going to do AJAX, you need to understand the HTML and the JavaScript. Frameworks that hide that from you are hurting you more than they are helping you (IMO).
JQuery has taken over the world it seems in terms of JavaScript frameworks. ASPMVC is well-integrated with it. I want to learn it, so there's great alignment here.
The whole ""control"" model is a neat idea, but it is more complicated than it appears on the surface. For example, look around on SO for questions about how a UserControl can find its highest level containing control and so forth. The control hierarchy abstraction has leaks in it. Grids are great if they do what you want out of the box, but it's very very hard to customize them to do something they weren't made to do. And the best grid controls on the market (the ones that are highly customizable) are large, bloated, overly complicated beasts. Maybe that shows us that we should drop back down to HTML and let loops in our views do that kind of thing for us.
I believe I can build complete, beautiful apps in ASPMVC much faster than in ASP.Net (and I've got some years of ASP.Net under my belt). Look at StackOverflow ... built quickly on ASPMVC with JQuery, and it's fast, scalable and a joy to use IMO.
Oh, and it's completely open source! It is ok to read the source code, blog about it, and even modify then redistribute it!

Now to answer your questions...

Does the fragment also retain its view state, or will this be recreated on configuration change - what exactly is ""retained""?

Yes, the Fragment's state will be retained across the configuration change. Specifically, ""retained"" means that the fragment will not be destroyed on configuration changes. That is, the Fragment will be retained even if the configuration change causes the underlying Activity to be destroyed.

Will the fragment be destroyed when the user leaves the activity?

Just like Activitys, Fragments may be destroyed by the system when memory resources are low. Whether you have your fragments retain their instance state across configuration changes will have no effect on whether or not the system will destroy the Fragments once you leave the Activity. If you leave the Activity (i.e. by pressing the home button), the Fragments may or may not be destroyed. If you leave the Activity by pressing the back button (thus, calling finish() and effectively destroying the Activity), all of the Activitys attached Fragments will also be destroyed.

Why doesn't it work with fragments on the back stack?

There are probably multiple reasons why it's not supported, but the most obvious reason to me is that the Activity holds a reference to the FragmentManager, and the FragmentManager manages the backstack. That is, no matter if you choose to retain your Fragments or not, the Activity (and thus the FragmentManager's backstack) will be destroyed on a configuration change. Another reason why it might not work is because things might get tricky if both retained fragments and non-retained fragments were allowed to exist on the same backstack.

Which are the use cases where it makes sense to use this method?

Retained fragments can be quite useful for propagating state information â especially thread management â across activity instances. For example, a fragment can serve as a host for an instance of Thread or AsyncTask, managing its operation. See my blog post on this topic for more information.
In general, I would treat it similarly to using onConfigurationChanged with an Activity... don't use it as a bandaid just because you are too lazy to implement/handle an orientation change correctly. Only use it when you need to.

public void setRetainInstance (boolean retain)
Control whether a fragment instance is retained across Activity re-creation (such as from a configuration change). This can only be used with fragments not in the back stack. If set, the fragment lifecycle will be slightly different when an activity is recreated:

onDestroy() will not be called (but onDetach() still will be, because the fragment is being detached from its current activity).
onCreate(Bundle) will not be called since the fragment is not being re-created.
onAttach(Activity) and onActivityCreated(Bundle) will still be called.

Does the fragment also retain its view, or will this be recreated on configuration change? What exactly is ""retained""?

If you need to subdivide logging activity inside a module, use e.g.

loggerB = logging.getLogger(__name__ + '.B')

and log to loggerA and loggerB as appropriate.

With the value set to False, existing loggers are left alone.

28171587,674326.0,2015-01-27 13:23:11+00:00,28145890,67,"Rx schedulers provide an abstraction that allows work to be scheduled to run, possibly in the future, without the calling code needing to be aware of the mechanism used to schedule the work.
Whenever an Rx method needs to generate a notification, it schedules the work on a scheduler.  By supplying a scheduler to the Rx method instead of using the default, you can subtly control how those notifications are sent out.
In server-side implementations of Rx (such as Rx.NET), schedulers play an important role.  They allow you to schedule heavy duty work on the thread pool or dedicated threads, and run the final subscription on the UI thread so you can update your UI.
When using RxJs, it is actually pretty rare that you need to worry about the scheduler argument to most methods.  Since JavaScript is essentially single-threaded, there are not a lot of options for scheduling and the default schedulers are usually the right choice.
The only real choices are:

immediateScheduler - Runs the work synchronously and immediately.  Sort of like not using a scheduler at all.  Work scheduled thus is guaranteed to run synchronously.
currentThreadScheduler - Similar to immediateScheduler in that the work is run immediately.  However, it does not run work recursively.  So, if the work is running and schedules more work, then that additional work is put into queue to be run after the current work finishes.  Thus work sometimes runs synchronously and sometimes asynchronously.  This scheduler is useful to avoid stack overflows or infinite recursion.  For example Rx.Observable.of(42).repeat().subscribe() would cause infinite recursion if it ran on the immediate scheduler, but since return runs on the currentThread scheduler by default, infinite recursion is avoided.
timeoutScheduler - The only scheduler that supports work scheduled to be run in the future.  Essentially uses setTimeout to schedule all work (though if you schedule the work to be run ""now"", then it uses other faster asynchronous methods to schedule the work).  Any work scheduled on this scheduler is guaranteed to be run asynchronously.

There may be some more now, such as a scheduler that schedules work on the browser animation frames, etc.
If you are trying to write testable code, then you almost always want to supply the scheduler argument.  This is because in your unit tests, you will be creating testScheduler instances, which will let your unit test control the clock used by your Rx code (and thus control the exact timing of the operations).

list() and dict() are separate objects. Their names need to be resolved, the stack has to be involved to push the arguments, the frame has to be stored to retrieve later, and a call has to be made. That all takes more time.
For the empty case, that means you have at the very least a LOAD_NAME (which has to search through the global namespace as well as the __builtin__ module) followed by a CALL_FUNCTION, which has to preserve the current frame:
>>> dis.dis(compile('list()', '', 'eval'))
  1           0 LOAD_NAME                0 (list)
              3 CALL_FUNCTION            0
              6 RETURN_VALUE        
>>> dis.dis(compile('dict()', '', 'eval'))
  1           0 LOAD_NAME                0 (dict)
              3 CALL_FUNCTION            0
              6 RETURN_VALUE        

You can time the name lookup separately with timeit:
>>> import timeit
>>> timeit.timeit('list', number=10**7)
0.30749011039733887
>>> timeit.timeit('dict', number=10**7)
0.4215109348297119

The time discrepancy there is probably a dictionary hash collision. Subtract those times from the times for calling those objects, and compare the result against the times for using literals:
>>> timeit.timeit('[]', number=10**7)
0.30478692054748535
>>> timeit.timeit('{}', number=10**7)
0.31482696533203125
>>> timeit.timeit('list()', number=10**7)
0.9991960525512695
>>> timeit.timeit('dict()', number=10**7)
1.0200958251953125

So having to call the object takes an additional 1.00 - 0.31 - 0.30 == 0.39 seconds per 10 million calls.
You can avoid the global lookup cost by aliasing the global names as locals (using a timeit setup, everything you bind to a name is a local):
>>> timeit.timeit('_list', '_list = list', number=10**7)
0.1866450309753418
>>> timeit.timeit('_dict', '_dict = dict', number=10**7)
0.19016098976135254
>>> timeit.timeit('_list()', '_list = list', number=10**7)
0.841480016708374
>>> timeit.timeit('_dict()', '_dict = dict', number=10**7)
0.7233691215515137

but you never can overcome that CALL_FUNCTION cost.

I ran the same test with {} and dict() and the results were practically identical: [] and {} both took around 0.128sec / million cycles, while list() and dict() took roughly 0.428sec / million cycles each.
Why is this? Do [] and {} (probably () and '', too) immediately pass back a copies of some empty stock literal while their explicitly-named counterparts (list(), dict(), tuple(), str()) fully go about creating an object, whether or not they actually have elements?
I have no idea how these two methods differ but I'd love to find out.
I couldn't find an answer in the docs or on SO, and searching for empty brackets turned out to be more complicated than I'd expected.
I got my timing results by calling timeit.timeit(""[]"") and timeit.timeit(""list()""), and timeit.timeit(""{}"") and timeit.timeit(""dict()""), to compare lists and dictionaries, respectively. I'm running Python 2.7.9.
I recently discovered ""Why is if True slower than if 1?"" that compares the performance of if True to if 1 and seems to touch on a similar literal-versus-global scenario; perhaps it's worth considering as well.

Accept the most basic type that will work
Return the richest type your user will need

So when writing a function or method that takes a collection, write it not to take a List, but an IList<T>, an ICollection<T>, or IEnumerable<T>.  The generic interfaces will still work even for heterogenous lists because System.Object can be a T too.  Doing this will save you headache if you decide to use a Stack or some other data structure further down the road.  If all you need to do in the function is foreach through it, IEnumerable<T> is really all you should be asking for.
On the other hand, when returning an object out of a function, you want to give the user the richest possible set of operations without them having to cast around.  So in that case, if it's a List<T> internally, return a copy as a List<T>.

It might help to look at a simple example.  Consider this 1-input, 1-output network that has no bias:

The output of the network is computed by multiplying the input (x) by the weight (w0) and passing the result through some kind of activation function (e.g. a sigmoid function.)
Here is the function that this network computes, for various values of w0:

Changing the weight w0 essentially changes the ""steepness"" of the sigmoid.  That's useful, but what if you wanted the network to output 0 when x is 2?  Just changing the steepness of the sigmoid won't really work -- you want to be able to shift the entire curve to the right.
That's exactly what the bias allows you to do.  If we add a bias to that network, like so:

...then the output of the network becomes sig(w0*x + w1*1.0).  Here is what the output of the network looks like for various values of w1:

Having a weight of -5 for w1 shifts the curve to the right, which allows us to have a network that outputs 0 when x is 2.

Update to Preface: The .NET Framework 4.5 and later have fixed the compression problem, and GZipStream and DeflateStream use zlib in those versions.  I do not know if the CRC problem referenced below has been fixed.
Another update: The CRC problem is not only not fixed, but Microsoft has decided that they won't fix it!
This is one of several bugs in GZipStream.  No self-respecting gzip compressor should ever produce 133 bytes of output from 11 bytes of input.  See my comments at Why does BCL GZipStream (with StreamReader) not reliably detect Data Errors with CRC32? .
What is happening internally is that GZipStream is not using the static or stored methods, both of which would produce compressed data about the same size as the input data (on top of which would be added 18 bytes of gzip header and trailer).  Instead it is using the dynamic method, which creates a very large code descriptor header for a very small number of codes.  It is simply a bug / very bad implementation.
Update:
With the hex dumps, I can provide some analysis. First, both the Fiddler and php output are correct and proper.  The only difference between them is in the gzip header, in particular the timestamp set in Fiddler but not in php, and the originating operating system set in php but not in Fiddler.  For both the 13 bytes of compressed data is identical, and can be represented as (using my infgen program to disassemble deflate streams):
last
static
literal 'Hello World
end

which is exactly as it should be.  A single static block, which requires no code descriptors, and simply coding all of the bytes as literals.  (No matches of previous strings with lengths and distances.)
The output of GZipStream on the other hand is a horrible mess in several ways.  The compressed data is:

literal 'Hello World
end
!
last
stored
end

So what is all that?  The actual data is just the line near the end ""literal 'Hello World"", which just codes each byte of the input.  What precedes it is a description of a set of Huffman codes for literals, lengths, and distances.  Here are the things wrong with it:

First off, it should not be using dynamic at all.  Describing the set of codes takes about 100 bytes.  This is precisely why the deflate format provides a pre-defined set of codes used in static blocks.  The compressor should select a static block in this case (which is what php and Fiddler are doing).
Second, every single possible code is defined, even though the vast majority are never used!  When using a dynamic block, a proper compressor will only define codes for literals, lengths, and distances actually used in that block.  In this case there are no lengths or distances used, and only eight different literals used (H, e, l, o, space, w, r, and d).  Instead it proceeds to define 256 literal codes, 29 length codes, and 30 distance codes. I am guessing that some experimentation will show that the dynamic header from GZipStream is always the same, in which case it's not even dynamic, which is the whole point!
Third, it throws in an unnecessary empty stored block at the end.  The first block should have been marked as the last block.

All of this points to the simple fact that whoever wrote this GZipStream code was, to put it as politely as I can, lacking in any understanding of the deflate format or compression in general.  They elected to produce only dynamic blocks (except for an empty static block at the end), to only produce the same dynamic header every time (I think), defeating the purpose of dynamic blocks, and to not bother to figure out if the current block is last one, requiring putting out an empty block to mark the end.
As noted elsewhere, those aren't the only problems with GZipStream.  It can't even properly use the CRC-32 as intended to detect corrupt streams.
The truly perplexing thing is not why Microsoft assigned someone incompetent to write a gzip compressor and decompressor, but rather why they assigned anyone at all to write it!  There is freely available code, zlib, that has an extremely liberal license that permits commercial use with no attribution.  This code has been deployed widely for almost two decades, and does all the things it's supposed to do correctly and efficiently.  Most everything else uses zlib, including php and I suspect Fiddler as well.
",11435200,69824.0,2012-07-11 14:43:26+00:00,,30,Why does my C# gzip produce a larger file than Fiddler or PHP?,"If I GZip this text:

Hello World

through C# using this code:
Stream stream = new MemoryStream(Encoding.Default.GetBytes(""Hello World""));
var compressedMemoryStream = new MemoryStream();
using (var gzipStream = new GZipStream(compressedMemoryStream, CompressionMode.Compress))
{
    stream.CopyTo(gzipStream);  
    gzipStream.Close(); 
} 

the resulting stream is 133 bytes long
Running the same string through either Fiddler's Utilities.GzipCompress or this PHP page the result is only 31 bytes long.
In both cases the input is 11 bytes, so I would imagine the PHP result is correct but obviously this means that I can't decompress the PHP zip from within .NET or visa-versa. Why is the .NET output so much larger?

Actually it turns out that while the result from PHP and Fiddler are the same length that they are not the same. I can decompress the PHP version in .NET, but not the Fiddler version. The PHP page decompresses all three, so it looks like there may be an incompatibility between Fiddler's and .NET's implementations of gzip. 

As requested I've uploaded the three outputs to dropbox here.
And these are the raw hexdumps of those files (not sure if they are really any use like this, but I think it shows that the difference between the fiddler and PHP version is in the header, rather than the compressed data itself):

23414798,3580294.0,2014-05-01 19:12:42+00:00,23414090,58,"Up-casting is casting to a supertype, while downcasting is casting to a subtype. Supercasting is always allowed, but subcasting involves a type check and can throw a ClassCastException.
In your case, a cast from from Dog to an Animal is a upcast, because a Dog is-a Animal. In general, you can upcast whenever there is an is-a relationship between two classes.
Downcasting would be something like this:
Animal animal = new Dog();
Dog castedDog = (Dog) animal;

Basically what you're doing is telling the program that you know what the runtime type of the object really is. The program will do the conversion, but will still do a sanity check to make sure that it's possible. In this case, the cast is possible because at runtime animal is actually a Dog even though the static type of animal is Animal.
However, if you were to do this:
Animal animal = new Animal();
Dog dog = (Dog) animal;

You'd get a ClassCastException. The reason why is because animal's runtime type is Animal, and so when you tell the runtime to perform the cast it sees that animal isn't really a Dog and so throws a ClassCastException.
To call a superclass's method you can do super.method() or be performing the upcast.
To call a subclass's method you have to do a downcast and risk the ClassCastException.

a couple of advantages taken from the documentation in comparision with InputStream:

This interface is functionally equivalent to InputStream.
  InputStream requires multiple layers when consumed data is heterogeneous: a DataInputStream for primitive values, a BufferedInputStream for buffering, and InputStreamReader for strings. This class uses BufferedSource for all of the above.
  Source avoids the impossible-to-implement available() method. Instead callers specify how many bytes they require.
Source omits the unsafe-to-compose mark and reset state that's tracked by InputStream; callers instead just buffer what they need.
When implementing a source, you need not worry about the single-byte read method that is awkward to implement efficiently and that returns one of 257 possible values.
And source has a stronger skip method: BufferedSource.skip(long) won't return prematurely.

    public static RequestBody create(final MediaType mediaType, 
            final InputStream inputStream) {

response = getClient().newCall(request).execute();

Now how do I convert the response to InputStream. Something similar to response from Apache HTTP Client like this for OkHttp response:
InputStream is = response.getEntity().getContent();


EDIT
Accepted answer from below.
My modified code:
request = new Request.Builder().url(urlString).build();
response = getClient().newCall(request).execute();

InputStream is = response.body().byteStream();

BufferedInputStream input = new BufferedInputStream(is);
OutputStream output = new FileOutputStream(file);

byte[] data = new byte[1024];

long total = 0;

while ((count = input.read(data)) != -1) {
    total += count;
    output.write(data, 0, count);
}

output.flush();
output.close();
input.close();

Alarm Manager
The Alarm Manager holds a CPU wake lock as long as the alarm receiver's onReceive() method is executing. This guarantees that the phone will not sleep until you have finished handling the broadcast. Once onReceive() returns, the Alarm Manager releases this wake lock. This means that the phone will in some cases sleep as soon as your onReceive() method completes. If your alarm receiver called Context.startService(), it is possible that the phone will sleep before the requested service is launched. To prevent this, your BroadcastReceiver and Service will need to implement a separate wake lock policy to ensure that the phone continues running until the service becomes available.
Note: The Alarm Manager is intended for cases where you want to have your application code run at a specific time, even if your application is not currently running. For normal timing operations (ticks, timeouts, etc) it is easier and much more efficient to use Handler.
Timer 
timer = new Timer();

    timer.scheduleAtFixedRate(new TimerTask() {

        synchronized public void run() {

            \\ here your todo;
            }

        }}, TimeUnit.MINUTES.toMillis(1), TimeUnit.MINUTES.toMillis(1));

Timer has some drawbacks that are solved by ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor. So it's not the best choice 
ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor.
You can use java.util.Timer or ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor (preferred) to schedule an action to occur at regular intervals on a background thread.
Here is a sample using the latter:
ScheduledExecutorService scheduler =
    Executors.newSingleThreadScheduledExecutor();

scheduler.scheduleAtFixedRate
      (new Runnable() {
         public void run() {
            // call service
         }
      }, 0, 10, TimeUnit.MINUTES);

So I preferred ScheduledExecutorService
But Also think about that if the updates will occur while your application is running, you can use a Timer, as suggested in other answers, or the newer ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor.
If your application will update even when it is not running, you should go with the AlarmManager.

The Alarm Manager is intended for cases where you want to have your application code run at a specific time, even if your application is not currently running.

Take note that if you plan on updating when your application is turned off, once every ten minutes is quite frequent, and thus possibly a bit too power consuming.

Objective-C:

Currently, I prefer avoiding defensive programming in favor of Test Driven Development. If you catch errors quickly and externally, you don't need to muddy-up your code with defensive maneuvers, your code is DRY-er and you wind-up with fewer errors that you have to defend against. 
As WikiKnowledge Wrote:

Avoid Defensive Programming, Fail Fast Instead. 
By defensive programming I
  mean the habit of writing code that
  attempts to compensate for some
  failure in the data, of writing code
  that assumes that callers might
  provide data that doesn't conform to
  the contract between caller and
  subroutine and that the subroutine
  must somehow cope with it.

Although my current languages are Java and Objective-C (with a background in C++), feel free to answer in any language.  Emphasis here would be on clever defensive techniques other than those that 70%+ of us here already know about.  So now it is time to dig deep into your bag of tricks.
In other words try to think of other than this uninteresting example:

if(5 == x) instead of if(x == 5):  to avoid unintended assignment

Here are some examples of some intriguing best defensive programming practices (language-specific examples are in Java):
- Lock down your variables until you know that you need to change them
That is, you can declare all variables final until you know that you will need to change it, at which point you can remove the final. One commonly unknown fact is that this is also valid for method params:
public void foo(final int arg) { /* Stuff Here */ }

- When something bad happens, leave a trail of evidence behind
There are a number of things you can do when you have an exception: obviously logging it and performing some cleanup would be a few.  But you can also leave a trail of evidence (e.g. setting variables to sentinel values like ""UNABLE TO LOAD FILE"" or 99999 would be useful in the debugger, in case you happen to blow past an exception catch-block).
- When it comes to consistency: the devil is in the details
Be as consistent with the other libraries that you are using.  For example, in Java, if you are creating a method that extracts a range of values make the lower bound inclusive and the upper bound exclusive.  This will make it consistent with methods like String.substring(start, end) which operates in the same way.  You'll find all of these type of methods in the Sun JDK to behave this way as it makes various operations including iteration of elements consistent with arrays, where the indices are from Zero (inclusive) to the length of the array (exclusive). 
So what are some favorite defensive practices of yours?
Update: If you haven't already, feel free to chime in.  I am giving a chance for more responses to come in before I choose the official answer.

Good Tests should be A TRIP (The acronymn isn't sticky enough - I have a printout of the cheatsheet in the book that I had to pull out to make sure I got this right..)

Automatic : Invoking of tests as well as checking results for PASS/FAIL should be automatic
Thorough: Coverage; Although bugs tend to cluster around certain regions in the code, ensure that you test all key paths and scenarios.. Use tools if you must to know untested regions
Repeatable: Tests should produce the same results each time.. every time. Tests should not rely on uncontrollable params.
Independent: Very important. 

Tests should test only one thing at a time. Multiple assertions are okay as long as they are all testing one feature/behavior. When a test fails, it should pinpoint the location of the problem.
Tests should not rely on each other - Isolated. No assumptions about order of test execution. Ensure 'clean slate' before each test by using setup/teardown appropriately

Professional: In the long run you'll have as much test code as production (if not more), therefore follow the same standard of good-design for your test code. Well factored methods-classes with intention-revealing names, No duplication, tests with good names, etc. 
Good tests also run Fast. any test that takes over half a second to run.. needs to be worked upon. The longer the test suite takes for a run.. the less frequently it will be run. The more changes the dev will try to sneak between runs.. if anything breaks.. it will take longer to figure out which change was the culprit.

Update 2010-08:

Readable : This can be considered part of Professional - however it can't be stressed enough. An acid test would be to find someone who isn't part of your team and asking him/her to figure out the behavior under test within a couple of minutes. Tests need to be maintained just like production code - so make it easy to read even if it takes more effort. Tests should be symmetric (follow a pattern) and concise (test one behavior at a time). Use a consistent naming convention (e.g. the TestDox style). Avoid cluttering the test with ""incidental details"".. become a minimalist.

Apart from these, most of the others are guidelines that cut down on low-benefit work: e.g. 'Don't test code that you don't own' (e.g. third-party DLLs). Don't go about testing getters and setters. Keep an eye on cost-to-benefit ratio or defect probability.

5988418,12711.0,2011-05-13 07:03:25+00:00,5987020,56,"In addition to the support for Link Time Code Generation (LTCG) that Jame McNellis mentioned, the GCC toolchain also supports link time optimization. Starting with version 4.5, GCC supports the -flto switch which enables Link Time Optimization (LTO), a form of whole program optimization that lets it inline functions from separate object files (and whatever other optimizations a compiler might be able to make if it were compiling all the object files as if they were from a single C source file).
Here's a simple example:
test.c:
void print_int(int x);

int main(){
    print_int(1);
    print_int(42);
    print_int(-1);

    return 0;
}

print_int.c:
#include <stdio.h>

void print_int( int x)
{
    printf( ""the int is %d\n"", x);
}

First compile them using GCC4.5.x - examples from GCC docs use -O2, but to get visible results in my simple test, I had to use -O3:
C:\temp>gcc --version
gcc (GCC) 4.5.2

# compile with preparation for LTO
C:\temp>gcc -c -O3 -flto test.c
C:\temp>gcc -c -O3 -flto print_int.c

# link without LTO
C:\temp>gcc -o test-nolto.exe  print_int.o test.o

To get the effect of LTO you're supposed to use the optimization options even at the link stage - the linker actually invokes the compiler to compile pieces of intermediate code that the compiler put into the object file in the first steps above.  If you don't pass the optimization option at this stage as well, the compiler won't perform the inlining that you'd be looking for.
# link using LTO
C:\temp>gcc -o test-lto.exe -flto -O3 print_int.o test.o

One thing that Microsoft's linker supports in LTCG that is not supported by GCC (as far as I know) is Profile Guided Optimization (PGO). That technology allows Microsoft's linker to optimize based on a profiling data gathered from previous runs of the program. This allows the linker to do things such as gather 'hot' functions onto the same memory pages and seldom used code sequences onto other memory pages to reduce the working set of a program.
 

Edit (28 Aug 2011): GCC support profile guided optimization using such options as -fprofile-generate and -fprofile-use, but I'm completely uninformed about them.
Thanks to Konrad Rudolph for pointing this out to me.

Are variables declared with let or const not hoisted? What is really going on here?

All declarations (var, let, const, function, function*, class) are hoisted in JavaScript. This means that if a name is declared in a scope, in that scope the identifier will always reference that particular variable:
x = ""global"";
// function scope:
(function() {
    x; // not ""global""

    var/let/â¦ x;
}());
// block scope (not for `var`s):
{
    x; // not ""global""

    let/const/â¦ x;
}

This is true both for function and block scopes1.
The difference between var/function/function* declarations and let/const/class declara­tions is the initialisation.
The former are initialised with undefined or the (generator) function right when the binding is created at the top of the scope. The lexically declared variables however stay uninitialised. This means that a ReferenceError exception is thrown when you try to access it. It will only get initialised when the let/const/class statement is evaluated, everything above that is called the temporal dead zone.
x = y = ""global"";
(function() {
    x; // undefined
    y; // Reference error: y is not defined

    var x = ""local"";
    let y = ""local"";
}());

Notice that a let y; statement initialises the variable with undefined like let y = undefined; would have.

Is there any difference between let and const in this matter?

No, they work the same as far as hoisting is regarded. The only difference between them is that a constant must be and can only be assigned in the initialiser part of the declaration (const one = 1;, both const one; and later reassignments like one = 2 are invalid).
1: var declarations are still working only on the function level, of course

1569487,48082.0,2009-10-14 23:05:03+00:00,1040840,52,"Definition of terms is important
When doing comparisons, the definition of terms is important.  EJB is a
component model.   It defines persistence, transaction, remoting, activation and
security capabilities (and maybe others) for components that operate within
the container. 
You can look at comparable technologies in .NET, if that is what you are
after - the technical capabilities of the component model. 
On the other hand some people use ""EJB"" as a term to loosely refer to
J2EE (or Java EE?).  In which case it refers not just to a component model, but
to a set of related Java technologies usually associated to server-side
applications, including a component model.  This might even include toolsets, which of course are
only tangentially related to the component model.  If that is the
comparison, then it is more aptly described as ""J2EE vs. .NET"". 
Still other people might be using an even fuzzier definition for EJB to
include things like web services capability, REST/XML communications, or
other stuff that is strictly outside Java EE or EJB proper. In other words when they say ""compare EJB to .NET"" they really mean to compare ""Server-side Java platforms to server-side .NET"".  The latter strikes me as a much more practical comparison to make, than comparing, say, component models.  
When doing the comparisons, it's important to be clear about just what
is being compared. 
EJB - the component model
In EJB you define an object and mark it as a Session Bean or an Entity
Bean.  There's also the late addition of Message Driven Bean.  Three
flavors of component in EJB.  The Session Bean gets activation - how it
gets started and possibly  ""passivated"" in times of high resource
contention on the server/container.  The SB also gets security and
remoting services.
The basic idea is to define an object and then attach attributes to it,
either through the deployment descriptor or through in-code attributes,
the analog for which is called annotations in Java. 
The closest thing to a EJB Session Bean is a .NET object.  In any .NET
application, you can mark an object with transaction attributes, just
like a EJB SB.  You can make it remotable, if you like, with .NET
Remoting and more attributes.  Outside of COM+, there is no passivation technology in
.NET; .NET just ignores pooling as a generally interesting thing to do with
in-memory objects, and as a result there's no approach to do activation/passivation in .NET as there is with EJB.


sidebar #1: that isn't quite true. In .NET, the Workflow capability provides a facility to have long-running activities that can and will be passivated and re-activated.  But, Workflow is a distinct metaphor from ""server side objects"" or ""services"" which is the centerpoint of most server-side application architectures that use .NET. 



sidebar #2:  It used to be that the designers of server-side platforms thought everyone was gonna want to use object pooling in order to be more efficient. Now it turns out that the JVM and .NET CLR are fast enough at creating objects, and memory is plentiful enough, that in general, object pooling is not of practical use.  It is no longer interesting for the general case, though it still pays good dividends for expensive objects like database connections.  


As with EJB, in .NET you can attach security
attributes to an object to allow it to run or not run based on the
identity of the caller, or other ""evidence"". 
Entity Beans are a different animal.  While persistence and remoting can
be combined, in most practical guidebooks, the recommendation is that an
entity bean not expose a remote interface. Instead the recommendation calls for a
session bean to call an entity bean.  So let's just consider EB's as
persistent objects.  
In .NET there are a bunch of alternatives here. LINQ-to-SQL gives one
option - with ORM and persistence services. The ADO.NET Entity
Framework is maybe a more comparable technology. Of course all the other
services in .NET - transactions security and remoting etc - also can be
applied to objects that use ADO.NET Entity Framework or LINQ. 
On the other hand, depending on where your emphasis is in the EJB
umbrella, there may be better comparables. If you primarily use EJB for
remoting - and with the advent of REST, SOAP and other lightweight
protocols, almost no one does this anymore as far as I can tell - then a
better comparable in .NET is WCF.  
Finally, the comparable to EJB MDB are .NET Queued Components.  
EJB Remoting
There are some common aspects to all these types of EJBs - like remote interfaces. Actually most architects recommend that you don't distribute your EJBs.  In other words, they discourage people from using the remoting aspect that is so commonly discussed.  Instead a servlet should invoke an EJB that is local, rather than invoking one on a remote machine. This is Fowler's First Law: Don't distribute your objects.
On the other hand, sometimes you must.
WCF is the communications framework within .NET, and is the aspect in .NET most comparable to EJB remoting.  But they are not equivalent. WCF is a very general purpose framework for remote communications, supporting sync and async, multiple protocols, and extensible transport and channel model, while EJB remoting is fairly limited.   
Is starting from EJB the right approach?
EJB doesn't say anything (as far as I know) about web services, or REST,
or management or lightweight frameworks, or even HTML, or developer tools.  Starting a
comparison with ""EJB vs blank"" artificially constrains the discussion
a little bit.  It frames the discussion in a way that may not be
optimal. 
There's nothing in EJB to handle, for example, an HTML page metaphor.
You get that in servlets or one of its cousins (portlets, etc), some of which are in J2EE proper. But strictly speaking, HTML output isn't covered in EJB.  
Now, maybe you intend one of the more expansive definitions of
EJB. To that end, J2EE has now added web services into the specification.  But even so, I'm not sure how relevant it is to consider the spec, with the variety of add-on Java-based frameworks for SOAP web services and REST. 
Likewise, if you want to consider UI capabilities like portlets, servlets, and AJAX and compare them to the .NET equivalents, then you've moved well beyond EJB and J2EE and into server-side Java in general.  
It gets back to my earlier point - be clear and precise in your own mind about what
you are interested in examining or comparing.  

The EJB and J2EE specifications were ambitious - attempting to define the frameworks for server-side applications.  But there was always a time lag between what developers were doing, what the spec was saying, and what the vendors were delivering.  You know, maybe there was a 1-year lag between the finalization of a new version of the J2EE spec and the release of a compliant server from IBM. 
Because of this it ended up being sort of artificial, after-the-fact.  The spec was describing things that people were already doing. Things like Spring were coming out and J2EE wasn't saying anything about them. For the longest time J2EE had nothing to say about REST or Web services or AJAX.  (Even now, does it say anything about AJAX?  I don't know.) 
In light of the distance between the theory of the spec and the reality of actual practice by developers, a better approach might be to identify the application requirements, and
then compare the appropriateness of EJB and other related  technologies to the
apps you want to build.
In other words - suppose one of your requirements is that the app will be delivered via the browser, and it will have the responsiveness of AJAX.  In that case you're going to have to consider jQuery, and that isn't anywhere covered in J2EE, or EJB.  AJAX frameworks are available in various products (both Java and .NET). For example Visual Studio uses jQuery for the ASPNET AJAX stuff.  But sticking to the specs sort of misses this stuff.
Bottom Line
The bottom line is, any app that you build with EJBs can be built in
.NET, and vice versa. 
I think a comparison like ""EJB vs .NET"" can be interested as an academic
discussion, but if you want practical insight into what technology to
use where, then you need to think a little differently.  
You need to identify and prioritize requirements  - like speed of
development, cost of deployment, mechanism of deployment, tool support, deployment platform support,
language support, performance, UI appearance, UI options, etc.  Then weigh the options against that prioritized
list.

No additional logic on your objects. No extra tasks for testing.

It seems to work out great. The test runner results info will show the JSON string comparison (the object graph) included so you see directly what's wrong.
Also note! If you have bigger complex objects and just want to compare parts of them you can (use LINQ for sequence data) create anonymous objects to use with above method.

To understand Brainfuck you must imagine infinite array of cells initialized by 0 each.
...[0][0][0][0][0]...

When brainfuck program starts, it points to any cell.
...[0][0][*0*][0][0]...

If you move pointer right > you are moving pointer from cell X to cell X+1
...[0][0][0][*0*][0]...

If you increase cell value + you get:
...[0][0][0][*1*][0]...

If you increase cell value again + you get:
...[0][0][0][*2*][0]...

If you decrease cell value - you get:
...[0][0][0][*1*][0]...

If you move pointer left < you are moving pointer from cell X to cell X-1
...[0][0][*0*][1][0]...

2. Input
To read character you use comma ,. What it does is: Read character from standard input and write its decimal ASCII code to the actual cell.
Take a look at ASCII table. For example, decimal code of ! is 33, while a is 97.
Well, lets imagine your BF program memory looks like:
...[0][0][*0*][0][0]...

Assuming standard input stands for a, if you use comma , operator, what BF does is read a decimal ASCII code 97 to memory:
...[0][0][*97*][0][0]...

You generally want to think that way, however the truth is a bit more complex. The truth is BF does not read a character but a byte (whatever that byte is). Let me show you example:
In linux
$ printf Å

prints:
Å

which is specific polish character. This character is not encoded by ASCII encoding. In this case it's UTF-8 encoding, so it used to take more than one byte in computer memory. We can prove it by making a hexadecimal dump:
$ printf Å | hd

which shows:
00000000  c5 82                                             |..|

Zeroes are offset. 82 is first and c5 is second byte representing Å (in order we will read them). |..| is graphical representation which is not possible in this case.
Well, if you pass Å as input to your BF program that reads single byte, program memory will look like:
...[0][0][*197*][0][0]...

Why 197 ? Well 197 decimal is c5 hexadecimal. Seems familiar ? Of course. It's first byte of Å !
3. Output
To print character you use dot . What it does is: Assuming we treat actual cell value like decimal ASCII code, print corresponding character to standard output.
Well, lets imagine your BF program memory looks like:
...[0][0][*97*][0][0]...

If you use dot (.) operator now, what BF does is print:

a

Because a decimal code in ASCII is 97.
So for example BF program like this (97 pluses 2 dots):

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++..

Will increase value of the cell it points to up to 97 and print it out 2 times.

aa

4. Loops
In BF loop consists of loop begin [ and loop end ]. You can think it's like while in C/C++ where the condition is actual cell value.
Take a look BF program below:
++[]

++ increments actual cell value twice:
...[0][0][*2*][0][0]...

And [] is like while(2) {}, so it's infinite loop.
Let's say we don't want this loop to be infinite. We can do for example:
++[-]

So each time a loop loops it decrements actual cell value. Once actual cell value is 0 loop ends:
...[0][0][*2*][0][0]...        loop starts
...[0][0][*1*][0][0]...        after first iteration
...[0][0][*0*][0][0]...        after second iteration (loop ends)

Let's consider yet another example of finite loop:
++[>]

This example shows, we haven't to finish loop at cell that loop started on:
...[0][0][*2*][0][0]...        loop starts
...[0][0][2][*0*][0]...        after first iteration (loop ends)

However it is good practice to end where we started. Why ? Because if loop ends another cell it started, we can't assume where will cell pointer be. To be honest, this practice makes brainfuck less brainfuck.

I'd rather avoid the kind of thing which ends up being pretty religious with relatively little basis (e.g. brace placing) but examples might include things like ""unit testing isn't actually terribly helpful"" or ""public fields are okay really"".

1020330,120292.0,2009-06-19 22:32:04+00:00,1020070,78,"For Objective-C methods, the general practice is to put methods you wish to expose in the @interface section of the header file so other code can include only the .h and know how to interact with your code. Order-based ""lazy declaration"" works just like functions in C â you don't have to declare a method prototype unless you have a dependency that can't be resolved by ordering, but you can add method prototypes inside the @implementation if needed.
So yes, you're on the right track. Don't repeat the method prototype for inherited methods â the compiler finds it in the parent's header file. Delegate methods may be defined as prototypes in a category (tacked onto a class) and implemented as desired, but the delegate does not need to provide a method prototype, since it is already defined. (It still can if it wants to for clarity, etc.)
Since you're just learning Objective-C, the rest of this answer is much more detail than you asked for. You have been warned. ;-)

When you statically type a variable (e.g. MyClass* instead of id) the compiler will warn you when you try to call a method that a class doesn't advertise that it implements, whether it does or not. If you dynamically type the variable, the compiler won't stop you from calling whatever you like, and you'll only get runtime errors if you call something that doesn't exist. As far as the language is concerned, you can call any method that a class implements without errors at runtime â there is no way to restrict who can call a method.
Personally, I think this is actually a good thing. We get so used to encapsulation and protecting our code from other code that we sometimes treat the caller as a devious miscreant rather than a trustworthy coworker or customer. I find it's quite pleasant to code with a mindset of ""you do your job and I do mine"" where everyone respects boundaries and takes care of their own thing. You might say that the ""attitude"" of Objective-C is one of community trust, rather than of strict enforcement. For example, I'm happy to help anyone who comes to my desk, but would get really annoyed if someone messed with my stuff or moved things around without asking. Well-designed code doesn't have to be paranoid or sociopathic, it just has to work well together. :-)
That said, there are many approaches for structuring your interfaces, depending on the level of granularity you want/need in exposing interfaces to users. Any methods you declare in the public header are essentially fair game for anyone to use. Hiding method declarations is a bit like locking your car or house â it probably won't keep everyone out, but (1) it ""keeps honest people honest"" by not tempting them with something they shouldn't be messing with, and (2) anyone who does get in will certainly know they weren't supposed to, and can't really complain of negative consequences.
Below are some conventions I use for file naming, and what goes in each file â starting from a .m file at the bottom, each file includes the one above it. (Using a strict chain of includes will prevent things like duplicate symbol warnings.) Some of these levels only apply to larger reusable components, such as Cocoa frameworks. Adapt them according to your needs, and use whatever names suit you.

MyClass.h â Public API (Application Programming Interface)
MyClass_Private.h â Company-internal SPI (System Programming Interface)
MyClass_Internal.h â Project-internal IPI (Internal Programming Interface)
MyClass.m â Implementation, generally of all API/SPI/IPI declarations
MyClass_Foo.m â Additional implementation, such as for categories

API is for everyone to use, and is publicly supported (usually in Foo.framework/Headers). SPI exposes additional functionality for internal clients of your code, but with the understanding that support may be limited and the interface is subject to change (usually in Foo.framework/PrivateHeaders). IPI consists of implementation-specific details that should never be used outside the project itself, and these headers are not included in the framework at all. Anyone who chooses to use SPI and IPI calls does so at their own risk, and usually to their detriment when changes break their code. :-)

In object-oriented C++, you always need to declare your method before you define (implement) it, even if it is declared in the parent class.  
In procedural-style C, IIRC, you can get away with just defining a function so long as it is only called from something else in the same compilational unit (ie. the same file) that came later on in the file (well, provided you don't declare it elsewhere with ""extern"").
Now, in Objective-C, it appears that you only need to declare selectors in the header file if they are going to be used by something external, and that you can make up selectors in your .m file just fine, and call them within the .m file.  Also, it appears that delegate methods or inherited methods are never (re)defined.

Am I on the right track?  When do you need to define a selector in Objective-C?

OWIN is a specification on how web servers and web applications should be built in order to decouple one from another and allow movement of ASP.NET applications to environments where at the current state it is not possible.
Prior to OWIN, when you are building ASP.NET application, you are inheritedly bound to IIS due to the heavy dependency on System.Web assembly.
System.Web is something that exist ever since ASP (non .NET version) and internally contains many things that you might not even need (such as Web Forms or URL Authorization), which by the default run on every request, thus consuming the resources and making ASP.NET applications in general lot slower than it's counterparts at i.e. Node.js.
So OWIN itself does not have any tools, libraries or anything else. It is just a specification.
Katana on the other hand, is fully developed framework made to make a bridge between current ASP.NET frameworks and OWIN specification. At the moment, Katana has successfully adapted the following ASP.NET frameworks to OWIN:

Web API
Signal R

ASP.NET MVC and Web Forms are still running exclusively via System.Web, and in the long run there is a plan to decouple those as well.
On the other hand, IIS is good, resourceful host for web servers. Entire ASP.NET performance issue with using IIS has deep roots in System.Web only. Up until the recent time, when deciding how will you host your web server, you had two options:

IIS
Self-Host

So if you wanted a performance, you'd go for self-host option. If you wanted a lot of out-of-the-box features that IIS provides, you'd go for IIS but you'd lose on performance.
Now, there is a 3rd option, a Microsoft library named Helios (current codename) which intends to remove System.Web out of the way, and allow you to use IIS on more ""cleaner"" way, without any unnecessary libraries or modules. Helios is now in pre-release version, and is waiting for more community feedback in order to make it fully supported Microsoft product.
Hope this explanation clarifies things better for you.
EDIT:
With ASP.NET vNext being in development, Katana is slowly getting retired. Version 3.0 will most likely be last major release of Katana as a standalone framework.
However, all the concepts introduced with Katana are being integrated into ASP.NET vNext, meaning that programming model will be pretty much the same. Quote from forum post made by David Fowler (Architect of ASP.NET vNext):

vNext is the successor to Katana (which is why they look so similar).
  Katana was the beginning of the break away from System.Web and to more
  modular components for the web stack. You can see vNext as a
  continuation of that work but going much further (new CLR, new Project
  System, new http abstractions). 
Everything that exists today in Katana will make it's way into vNext.

EDIT:
ASP.NET vNext is now known as ASP.NET 5 and will be built on top of .NET Core 5. .NET Core 5 is lightweight factored version of .NET Framework, designed to support goals of ASP.NET 5 and .NET Native. However, ASP.NET 5 will be supported by .NET Framework 4.6 as well, that should become available together with .NET Core 5. Both ASP.NET 5 and .NET Core 5 will be licensed under MIT and will accept community contributions. 
EDIT:
Additionally, ASP.NET Web API brand will be discontinued, however it's technology will be base for new ASP.NET MVC 6. Previous ASP.NET MVC versions were built by implementing IHttpHandler, an interface defined in System.Web. ASP.NET MVC 6 removes that dependency, making it portable to various platforms and web servers.
EDIT:
ASP.NET 5 will officially be renamed to ASP.NET Core starting with Release Candidate 2 that is scheduled to be released soon.

With the release of Release Candidate 2, ASP.NET Core has been modified so that future web apps are actually just .NET Core console apps setup to process incoming HTTP requests. This concept makes ASP.NET Core even more aligned with approach Microsoft has taken with microservices architecture support and its implementation through Azure Service Fabric.

468272,22979.0,2009-01-22 07:07:24+00:00,406760,61,"Objects Should Never Be In An Invalid State
Unfortunately, so many of the ORM framework mandate zero-arg constructors for all entity classes, using setters to populate the member variables. In those cases, it's very difficult to know which setters must be called in order to construct a valid object.
MyClass c = new MyClass(); // Object in invalid state. Doesn't have an ID.
c.setId(12345); // Now object is valid.

In my opinion, it should be impossible for an object to ever find itself in an invalid state, and the class's API should actively enforce its class invariants after every method call.
Constructors and mutator methods should atomically transition an object from one valid state to another. This is much better:
MyClass c = new MyClass(12345); // Object starts out valid. Stays valid.

As the consumer of some library, it's a huuuuuuge pain to keep track of whether all the right setters have been invoked before attempting to use an object, since the documentation usually provides no clues about the class's contract.

ElementarySchool school = new ElementarySchool();
ElementarySchool school = SchoolFactory.Construct(); // new ElementarySchool() inside

No difference so far. Now imagine that we have various school types and we want to switch from using ElementarySchool to HighSchool (which is derived from an ElementarySchool or implements the same interface ISchool as the ElementarySchool). The code change would be:
HighSchool school = new HighSchool();
HighSchool school = SchoolFactory.Construct(); // new HighSchool() inside

In case of an interface we would have:
ISchool school = new HighSchool();
ISchool school = SchoolFactory.Construct(); // new HighSchool() inside

Now if you have this code in multiple places you can see that using factory method might be pretty cheap because once you change the factory method you are done (if we use the second example with interfaces).
And this is the main difference and advantage. When you start dealing with a complex class hierarchies and you want to dynamically create an instance of a class from such a hierarchy you get the following code. Factory methods might then take a parameter that tells the method what concrete instance to instantiate. Let's say you have a MyStudent class and you need to instantiate corresponding ISchool object so that your student is a member of that school. 
ISchool school = SchoolFactory.ConstructForStudent(myStudent);

Now you have one place in your app that contains business logic that determines what ISchool object to instantiate for different IStudent objects.
So - for simple classes (value objects, etc.) constructor is just fine (you don't want to overengineer your application) but for complex class hierarchies factory method is a preferred way. 
This way you follow the first design principle from the gang of four book ""Program to an interface, not an implementation"".

Constructors, or
Factory Methods

And what would be the considerations for using either of them?
In certain situations, I prefer having a factory method which returns null if the object cannot be constructed. This makes the code neat. I can simply check if the returned value is not null before taking alternative action, in contrast with throwing an exception from the constructor. (I personally don't like exceptions)
Say, I have a constructor on a class which expects an id value. The constructor uses this value to populate the class from the database. In the case where a record with the specified id does not exist, the constructor throws a RecordNotFoundException. In this case I will have to enclose the construction of all such classes within a try..catch block.
In contrast to this I can have a static factory method on those classes which will return null if the record is not found.
Which approach is better in this case, constructor or factory method?

730813,267.0,2009-04-08 16:33:02+00:00,730620,629,"Here's an explanation in layman's terms.
Let's assume you want to fill up a library of books and not just stuff them in there, but you want to be able to easily find them again when you need them.
So, you decide that if the person that wants to read a book knows the title of the book and the exact title to boot, then that's all it should take. With the title, the person, with the aid of the librarian, should be able to find the book easily and quickly.
So, how can you do that? Well, obviously you can keep some kind of list of where you put each book, but then you have the same problem as searching the library, you need to search the list. Granted, the list would be smaller and easier to search, but still you don't want to search sequentially from one end of the library (or list) to the other.
You want something that, with the title of the book, can give you the right spot at once, so all you have to do is just stroll over to the right shelf, and pick up the book.
But how can that be done? Well, with a bit of forethought when you fill up the library and a lot of work when you fill up the library.
Instead of just starting to fill up the library from one end to the other, you devise a clever little method. You take the title of the book, run it through a small computer program, which spits out a shelf number and a slot number on that shelf. This is where you place the book.
The beauty of this program is that later on, when a person comes back in to read the book, you feed the title through the program once more, and get back the same shelf number and slot number that you were originally given, and this is where the book is located.
The program, as others have already mentioned, is called a hash algorithm or hash computation and usually works by taking the data fed into it (the title of the book in this case) and calculates a number from it.
For simplicity, let's say that it just converts each letter and symbol into a number and sums them all up. In reality, it's a lot more complicated than that, but let's leave it at that for now.
The beauty of such an algorithm is that if you feed the same input into it again and again, it will keep spitting out the same number each time.
Ok, so that's basically how a hash table works.
Technical stuff follows.
First, there's the size of the number. Usually, the output of such a hash algorithm is inside a range of some large number, typically much larger than the space you have in your table. For instance, let's say that we have room for exactly one million books in the library. The output of the hash calculation could be in the range of 0 to one billion which is a lot higher.
So, what do we do? We use something called modulus calculation, which basically says that if you counted to the number you wanted (i.e. the one billion number) but wanted to stay inside a much smaller range, each time you hit the limit of that smaller range you started back at 0, but you have to keep track of how far in the big sequence you've come.
Say that the output of the hash algorithm is in the range of 0 to 20 and you get the value 17 from a particular title. If the size of the library is only 7 books, you count 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and when you get to 7, you start back at 0. Since we need to count 17 times, we have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 0, 1, 2, 3, and the final number is 3.
Of course modulus calculation isn't done like that, it's done with division and a remainder. The remainder of dividing 17 by 7 is 3 (7 goes 2 times into 17 at 14 and the difference between 17 and 14 is 3).
Thus, you put the book in slot number 3.
This leads to the next problem. Collisions. Since the algorithm has no way to space out the books so that they fill the library exactly (or the hash table if you will), it will invariably end up calculating a number that has been used before. In the library sense, when you get to the shelf and the slot number you wish to put a book in, there's already a book there.
Various collision handling methods exist, including running the data into yet another calculation to get another spot in the table, or simply to find a space close to the one you were given (i.e. right next to the previous book). This would mean that you have some digging to do when you try to find the book later, but it's still better than simply starting at one end of the library.
Finally, at some point, you might want to put more books into the library than the library allows. In other words, you need to build a bigger library. Since the exact spot in the library was calculated using the exact and current size of the library, it goes to follow that if you resize the library you might end up having to find new spots for all the books since the calculation done to find their spots has changed.
I hope this explanation was a bit more down to earth than buckets and functions :)

I have (for example) the javascript library ""MomentJS"" which deals with formatting and validating dates and I have uses for it throughout my app in controllers, services and filters. The way that I've learned (using AngularJS) is to create a service that references the function (and it's methods) and inject that service into my controllers, which works great.
The problem is that I really need to reference this library in all different kinds of components from services to filters to controllers and everything else. So, I guess my question is how do you do dependency injection in filters, services and everything else that isn't a controller?
Is this possible? Is this even beneficial?

34725116,1566221.0,2016-01-11 15:25:11+00:00,34724320,59,"The problem is that -2147483648 is not an integer literal. It's an expression consisting of the unary negation operator - and the integer 2147483648, which is too big to be an int if ints are 32 bits. Since the compiler will choose an appropriately-sized signed integer to represent 2147483648 before applying the negation operator, the type of the result will be larger than an int.
If you know that your ints are 32 bits, and want to avoid the warning without mutilating readability, use an explicit cast:
printf(""PRINTF(d) \t: %d\n"", (int)(-2147483648));

That's defined behaviour on a 2's complement machine with 32-bit ints.
For increased theoretical portability, use INT_MIN instead of the number, and let us know where you found a non-2's-complement machine to test it on. 

To be clear, that last paragraph was partly a joke. INT_MIN is definitely the way to go if you mean ""the smallest int"", because int varies in size. There are still lots of 16-bit implementations, for example. Writing out -231 is only useful if you definitely always mean precisely that value, in which case you would probably use a fixed-sized type like int32_t instead of int.
You might want some alternative to writing out the number in decimal to make it clearer for those who might not notice the difference between 2147483648 and 2174483648, but you need to be careful.
As mentioned above, on a 32-bit 2's-complement machine, (int)(-2147483648) will not overflow and is therefore well-defined, because -2147483648 will be treate as a wider signed type. However, the same is not true for (int)(-0x80000000). 0x80000000 will be treated as an unsigned int (since it fits into the unsigned representation); -0x80000000 is well-defined (but the - has no effect if int is 32 bits), and the conversion of the resulting unsigned int 0x80000000 to int involves an overflow. To avoid the overflow, you would need to cast the hex constant to a signed type: (int)(-(long long)(0x80000000)). 
Similarly, you need to take care if you want to use the left shift operator. 1<<31 is undefined behaviour on 32-bit machines with 32-bit (or smaller) ints; it will only evaluate to 231 if int is at least 33 bits, because left shift by k bits is only well-defined if k is strictly less than the number of non-sign bits of the integer type of the left-hand argument.
1LL<<31 is safe, since long long int is required to be able to represent 263-1, so its bit size must be greater than 32. So the form
(int)(-(1LL<<31))

is possibly the most readable. YMMV.

For any passing pedants, this question is tagged C, and the latest C draft (n1570.pdf) says, with respect to E1 << E2, where E1 has a signed type, that the value is defined only if E1 is nonnegative and E1 × 2E2 ""is representable in the result type"". (§6.5.7 para 4).
That's different from C++, in which the application of the left-shift operator is defined if E1 is nonnegative and E1 × 2E2 ""is representable
in the corresponding unsigned type of the result type"" (§5.8 para. 2, emphasis added).
In C++, according to the most recent draft standard, the conversion of an integer value to a signed integer type is implementation-defined if the value cannot be represented in the destination type (§4.7 para. 3). The corresponding paragraph of the C standard -- §6.3.1.3 para. 3 -- says that ""either the result is implementation-defined or an implementation-defined signal is raised"".)

By default, the value of the argument is passed by value - whether that value is a value type value or a reference. If an object is modified via that reference, then that change will be visible to the calling code as well.
In the code you showed originally, there was no reason to use ref. The ref keyword is used when you want a method that changes the value of a parameter (e.g. to make it refer to a different object entirely) and have that change visible to the caller.
Now, in the code you've shown (originally) you've only got:
private int BindMyObject(object reader, MyObject obj)
{
    //make changes to obj in here
}

Do you mean code like this:
private int BindMyObject(object reader, MyObject obj)
{
    obj = new MyObject();
}

or code like this:
private int BindMyObject(object reader, MyObject obj)
{
    obj.SomeProperty = differentValue;
}

? If it's the latter, then you don't need ref. If it's the former, then you do need ref because you're changing the parameter itself, not making changes to the object that the value refers to. In fact, if you're just setting the value of obj without ever reading it, you should use out instead of ref.
If you can show a short but complete program which demonstrates your problem, it'll be a lot easier to explain what's going on.
It's hard to do this topic justice in just a few paragraphs - so I've got an entire article about it, which will hopefully make things more obvious.

lock(obj) 

is a CLR construct that for (intra-object?) thread synchronization. Ensures that only one thread can take ownership of the object's lock & enter the locked block of code. Other threads must wait till the current owner relinquishes the lock by exiting the block of code. Also it is recommended that you lock on a private member object of your class.

Monitors 

lock(obj) is implemented internally using a Monitor. You should prefer lock(obj) because it prevents you from goofing up like forgetting the cleanup procedure. It 'idiot-proof's the Monitor construct if you will.
Using Monitor is generally preferred over mutexes, because monitors were designed specifically for the .NET Framework and therefore make better use of resources.

Using a lock or monitor is useful for preventing the simultaneous execution of thread-sensitive blocks of code, but these constructs do not allow one thread to communicate an event to another. This requires synchronization events, which are objects that have one of two states, signaled and un-signaled, that can be used to activate and suspend threads. 
Mutex, Semaphores are OS-level concepts. e.g with a named mutex you could synchronize across multiple (managed) exes (ensuring that only one instance of your application is running on the machine.)  
Mutex: 

Unlike monitors, however, a mutex can be used to synchronize threads across processes. When used for inter-process synchronization, a mutex is called a named mutex because it is to be used in another application, and therefore it cannot be shared by means of a global or static variable. It must be given a name so that both applications can access the same mutex object.
In contrast, the Mutex class is a wrapper to a Win32 construct. While it is more powerful than a monitor, a mutex requires interop transitions that are more computationally expensive than those required by the Monitor class. 

Semaphores (hurt my brain).

Use the Semaphore class to control access to a pool of resources. Threads enter the semaphore by calling the WaitOne method, which is inherited from the WaitHandle class, and release the semaphore by calling the Release method.
The count on a semaphore is decremented each time a thread enters the semaphore, and incremented when a thread releases the semaphore. When the count is zero, subsequent requests block until other threads release the semaphore. When all threads have released the semaphore, the count is at the maximum value specified when the semaphore was created. 
A thread can enter the semaphore multiple times..The Semaphore class does not enforce thread identity on WaitOne or Release.. programmers responsibility to not muck up.
Semaphores are of two types: local semaphores and named system semaphores. If you create a Semaphore object using a constructor that accepts a name, it is associated with an operating-system semaphore of that name. Named system semaphores are visible throughout the operating system, and can be used to synchronize the activities of processes.
A local semaphore exists only within your process. It can be used by any thread in your process that has a reference to the local Semaphore object. Each Semaphore object is a separate local semaphore.

This is even worse when I want for example to render it recursively. Is there a way to render partial views with a prefix, or, even better, with automatic reconition of the calling lambda expression so that

Currently I think about coding this myself but it seems like a waste of time, I can't believe this trivial stuff is not implemented already.
A lot of manual solutions may exists, and all of them are welcome. For example, I can force my partials to be based off IPartialViewModel<T> { public string Prefix; T Model; }. But I'd rather prefer some existing/approved solution.

The program is as follows:

Here is the output I received when trying to compile this program with Visual C++ 2010:

Dismayed, I tried g++ 4.5.2, but it was equally unhelpful:
c:\dev>g++ helloworld.png
helloworld.png: file not recognized: File format not recognized
collect2: ld returned 1 exit status

I figured that Clang (version 3.0 trunk 127530) must work, since it is so highly praised for its standards conformance.  Unfortunately, it didn't even give me one of its pretty, highlighted error messages:
c:\dev>clang++ helloworld.png
helloworld.png: file not recognized: File format not recognized
collect2: ld returned 1 exit status
clang++: error: linker (via gcc) command failed with exit code 1 (use -v to see invocation)

To be honest, I don't really know what any of these error message mean.
Many other C++ programs have source files with a .cpp extension, so I thought perhaps I needed to rename my file.  I changed its name to helloworld.cpp, but that didn't help.  I think there is a very serious bug in Clang because when I tried using it to compile the renamed program, it flipped out, printed ""84 warnings and 20 errors generated."" and made my computer beep a lot!
What have I done wrong here?  Have I missed some critical part of the C++ Standard?  Or are all three compilers really just so broken that they can't compile this simple program?

This is a C++ interview test question not homework. 

Then your interviewer needs to refresh his recollection with how the C++ standard works. And I quote:

For an enumeration whose underlying type is not fixed, the underlying type is an integral type that can represent all the enumerator values defined in the enumeration.

The whole ""whose underlying type is not fixed"" part is from C++11, but the rest is all standard C++98/03. In short, the sizeof(months_t) is not 4. It is not 2 either. It could be any of those. The standard does not say what size it should be; only that it should be big enough to fit any enumerator.

why the all size is 4 bytes ? not 12 x 4 = 48 bytes ?

Because enums are not variables. The members of an enum are not actual variables; they're just a semi-type-safe form of #define. They're a way of storing a number in a reader-friendly format. The compiler will transform all uses of an enumerator into the actual numerical value.
Enumerators are just another way of talking about a number. january is just shorthand for 0. And how much space does 0 take up? It depends on what you store it in.

Take a mathematical problem that is believed to be true for all positive integer's n, but hasn't been proven to be true for every n. A good example would be Goldbach's conjecture, that any positive even integer greater than two can be represented by the sum of two primes. Then (with an appropriate bigint library) run this program (pseudocode follows):
 for (BigInt n = 4; ; n+=2) {
     if (!isGoldbachsConjectureTrueFor(n)) {
         print(""Conjecture is false for at least one value of n\n"");
         exit(0);
     }
 }

Implementation of isGoldbachsConjectureTrueFor() is left as an exercise for the reader but for this purpose could be a simple iteration over all primes less than n
Now, logically the above must either be the equivalent of:
 for (; ;) {
 }

(i.e. an infinite loop) or
print(""Conjecture is false for at least one value of n\n"");

as Goldbach's conjecture must either be true or not true. If a compiler could always eliminate dead code, there would definitely be dead code to eliminate here in either case. However, in doing so at the very least your compiler would need to solve arbitrarily hard problems. We could provide problems provably hard that it would have to solve (e.g. NP-complete problems) to determine which bit of code to eliminate. For instance if we take this program:
 String target = ""f3c5ac5a63d50099f3b5147cabbbd81e89211513a92e3dcd2565d8c7d302ba9c"";
 for (BigInt n = 0; n < 2**2048; n++) {
     String s = n.toString();
     if (sha256(s).equals(target)) {
         print(""Found SHA value\n"");
         exit(0);
     }
 }

we know that the program will either print out ""Found SHA value"" or ""Not found SHA value"" (bonus points if you can tell me which one is true). However, for a compiler to be able to reasonably optimise that would take of the order of 2^2048 iterations. It would in fact be a great optimisation as I predict the above program would (or might) run until the heat death of the universe rather than printing anything without optimisation.

Use C-xC-e to open the current line in the editor specified by $FCEDIT or $EDITOR or emacs (tried in that order).
If you ran the command earlier, hit Ctrl+r for a reverse history search and type option25 (in this case). The line will be displayed. Hit TAB to start editing at this point.
Use history expansion with the s/// modifier. E.g. !-2:s/--option25/--newoption/ would rerun the second-to-last command, but replace option25. To modify the last ./cmd command, use the !string syntax: !./cmd:s/--option25/--newoption/
Any delimiter may be used in place of / in the substitution.
If editing the previous line, you can use quick substitution: ^--option25^--newoption
Character search. This was mentioned by Pax, and can be done in regular emacs-mode with C-] for forward search, and C-M-] for backward search.

I recommend the second option. Ctrl+r is really handy and fast, no mucking about with editors, and you see the results before the command is run (unlike the history expansions).

Some extra information:

Why are you binding to all of those events? ""scroll mousewheel etc...""

There are many different types of scroll events. You can scroll down using your mouse, keyboard, touchscreen, etc. With this we make sure to catch all of them.

What is the use of var page = $(""html, body"");? Can't I just use $(""html, body"") everywhere?

If you use the same selector more than once, it's good practice to cache them in a variable. It will be easier to write/use, and has better performance than having the program re-calculate the selector every time.

Where can I find more info on .animate() and .stop()?

You can read the jQuery documentation for .animate() and .stop(). I also recommend reading about animation queue's since .stop() works on this principle.

The keys you use to inspect the userInfo dictionary can be found in the reference docs here.

void foo() const

and
void foo()

Now, since a is not const, the non-const version is the best match, so the compiler picks void foo(). Then the access restrictions are put in place and you get a compiler error, since void foo() is private.
Remember, in overload resolution it is not 'find the best usable function'. It is 'find the best function and try to use it'. If it can't because of access restrictions or being deleted, then you get a compiler error.

In other words why does overload resolution comes before access control?

Well, let's look at:
struct Base
{
    void foo() { std::cout << ""Base\n""; }
};

struct Derived : Base
{
    void foo() { std::cout << ""Derived\n""; }

This could be very hard to track down in a large code base.

The initialization prints ""Hello, world!\n"", and sets the value of variable ""main"" to 195. After all initialization is done, the C/C++ environment makes a call to ""main"". The program returns immediately from this call because we put a RET instruction (code 195) at the address of ""main"".

keep a database of all URLs
when you insert a new URL into the database, find out the id of the auto-incrementing integer primary key.
encode that integer into base 36 or 62 (digits + lowercase alpha or digits + mixed-case alpha). Voila! You have a short url!

Encoding to base 36/decoding from base 36 is simple in Ruby:
12341235.to_s(36)
#=> ""7cik3""

""7cik3"".to_i(36)
#=> 12341235

Encoding to base 62 is a bit tricker. Here's one way to do it:
module AnyBase
  ENCODER = Hash.new do |h,k|
    h[k] = Hash[ k.chars.map.with_index.to_a.map(&:reverse) ]
  end
  DECODER = Hash.new do |h,k|
    h[k] = Hash[ k.chars.map.with_index.to_a ]
  end
  def self.encode( value, keys )
    ring = ENCODER[keys]
    base = keys.length
    result = []
    until value == 0
      result << ring[ value % base ]
      value /= base
    end
    result.reverse.join
  end
  def self.decode( string, keys )
    ring = DECODER[keys]
    base = keys.length
    string.reverse.chars.with_index.inject(0) do |sum,(char,i)|
      sum + ring[char] * base**i
    end
  end
end

...and here it is in action:
base36 = ""0123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz""
db_id = 12341235
p AnyBase.encode( db_id, base36 )
#=> ""7cik3""
p AnyBase.decode( ""7cik3"", base36 )
#=> 12341235

base62 = [ *0..9, *'a'..'z', *'A'..'Z' ].join
p AnyBase.encode( db_id, base62 )
#=> ""PMwb""
p AnyBase.decode( ""PMwb"", base62 )
#=> 12341235

Edit
If you want to avoid URLs that happen to be English words (for example, four-letter swear words) you can use a set of characters that does not include vowels:
base31 = ([*0..9,*'a'..'z'] - %w[a e i o u]).join
base52 = ([*0..9,*'a'..'z',*'A'..'Z'] - %w[a e i o u A E I O U]).join

However, with this you still have problems like AnyBase.encode(328059,base31) or AnyBase.encode(345055,base31) or AnyBase.encode(450324,base31). You may thus want to avoid vowel-like numbers as well:
base28 = ([*'0'..'9',*'a'..'z'] - %w[a e i o u 0 1 3]).join
base49 = ([*'0'..'9',*'a'..'z',*'A'..'Z'] - %w[a e i o u A E I O U 0 1 3]).join

This will also avoid the problem of ""Is that a 0 or an O?"" and ""Is that a 1 or an I?"".

Why can <script> Tags be visible?

Because they are HTML elements like any other and there is no reason to write special case rules in the HTML specification (which would add complexity) to prevent CSS from applying to them.
Any element can be styled. Take, for example:

title { display: block; }

meta[content]:after { display: block; content: attr(content); }

292840,23633.0,2008-11-15 18:00:47+00:00,292820,73,"The C# compiler's default implementation of adding an event handler calls Delegate.Combine, while removing an event handler calls Delegate.Remove:
Fire = (MyDelegate) Delegate.Remove(Fire, new MyDelegate(Program.OnFire));

The Framework's implementation of Delegate.Remove doesn't look at the MyDelegate object itself, but at the method the delegate refers to (Program.OnFire). Thus, it's perfectly safe to create a new MyDelegate object when unsubscribing an existing event handler. Because of this, the C# compiler allows you to use a shorthand syntax (that generates exactly the same code behind the scenes) when adding/removing event handlers: you can omit the new MyDelegate part:
Fire += OnFire;
Fire -= OnFire;

When the last delegate is removed from the event handler, Delegate.Remove returns null. As you have found out, it's essential to check the event against null before raising it:
MyDelegate handler = Fire;
if (handler != null)
    handler(""Hello 3"");

It's assigned to a temporary local variable to defend against a possible race condition with unsubscribing event handlers on other threads. (See my blog post for details on the thread safety of assigning the event handler to a local variable.) Another way to defend against this problem is to create an empty delegate that is always subscribed; while this uses a little more memory, the event handler can never be null (and the code can be simpler):
public static event MyDelegate Fire = delegate { };

",292820,23772.0,2008-11-15 17:50:08+00:00,,52,How to correctly unregister an event handler,"In a code review, I stumbled over this (simplified) code fragment to unregister an event handler:
 Fire -= new MyDelegate(OnFire);

I thought that this does not unregister the event handler because it creates a new delegate which had never been registered before. But searching MSDN I found several code samples which use this idiom.
So I started an experiment:
internal class Program
{
    public delegate void MyDelegate(string msg);
    public static event MyDelegate Fire;

    private static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        Fire += new MyDelegate(OnFire);
        Fire += new MyDelegate(OnFire);
        Fire(""Hello 1"");
        Fire -= new MyDelegate(OnFire);
        Fire(""Hello 2"");
        Fire -= new MyDelegate(OnFire);
        Fire(""Hello 3"");
    }

    private static void OnFire(string msg)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(""OnFire: {0}"", msg);
    }

}

To my surprise, the following happened:

Fire(""Hello 1""); produced two messages, as expected.
Fire(""Hello 2""); produced one message!
This convinced me that unregistering new delegates works!
Fire(""Hello 3""); threw a NullReferenceException.
 Debugging the code showed that Fire is null after unregistering the event.

I know that for event handlers and delegate, the compiler generates a lot of code behind the scene. But I still don't understand why my reasoning is wrong.
What am I missing?
Additional question: from the fact that Fire is null when there are no events registered, I conclude that everywhere an event is fired, a check against null is required.

color.status.<slot>


Use customized color for status colorization.
<slot> is one of:

header (the header text of the status message), 
added or updated (files which are added but not committed), 
changed (files which are changed but not added in the index), 
untracked (files which are not tracked by git), 
branch (the current branch), or 
nobranch (the color the no branch warning is shown in, defaulting to red). 

The values of these variables may be specified as in color.branch.<slot>.

So this will work:
git config color.status.changed blue
git config color.status.untracked magenta

However:
new files = green
deleted files = red

Isn't possible: you need to pick one color: 

if they are added to the index, they will pick the color for color.status.added.
if they aren't added to the index, they will pick the color or  color.status.modified.


Of course, as commented by elboletaire:

Remember to enable coloring output if it has not been enabled previously:

git config --global color.ui true


Shaun Luttin adds:
The command can also take multiple parameters in quotes. This includes two colors (foreground background) from this list:

normal, black, red, green, yellow, blue, magenta, cyan and white; 

and it also includes one attribute (style) from this list:

bold, dim, ul, blink and reverse. 

So this will work:
git config color.status.changed ""blue normal bold""
git config color.status.header ""white normal dim""


Note: with git 2.9.1 (July 2016), The output coloring scheme learned two new attributes, italic and strike, in addition to existing bold, reverse, etc.

The real difficulty in testing C code is breaking the dependencies on external modules so you can isolate code in units.  This can be especially problematic when you are trying to get tests around legacy code.  In this case I often find myself using the linker to use stubs functions in tests.
This is what people are referring to when they talk about ""seams"".  In C your only option really is to use the pre-processor or the linker to mock out your dependencies.
A typical test suite in one of my C projects might look like this:
#include ""myimplementationfile.c""
#include <gtest/gtest.h>

// Mock out external dependency on mylogger.o
void Logger_log(...){}

TEST(FactorialTest, Zero) {
    EXPECT_EQ(1, Factorial(0));
}

Note that you are actually including the C file and not the header file.  This gives the advantage of access to all the static data members.  Here I mock out my logger (which might be in logger.o and give an empty implementation.  This means that the test file compiles and links independently from the rest of the code base and executes in isolation.
As for cross-compiling the code, for this to work you need good facilities on the target.  I have done this with googletest cross compiled to Linux on a PowerPC architecture.    This makes sense because there you have a full shell and os to gather your results.  For less rich environments (which I classify as anything without a full OS) you should just build and run on the host.  You should do this anyway so you can run the tests automatically as part of the build.
I find testing C++ code is generally much easier due to the fact that OO code is in general much less coupled than procedural (of course this depends a lot on coding style).  Also in C++ you can use tricks like dependency injection and method overriding to get seams into code that is otherwise encapsulated.
Michael Feathers has an excellent book about testing legacy code.  In one chapter he covers techniques for dealing with non-OO code which I highly recommend.
Edit: I've written a blog post about unit testing procedural code, with source available on GitHub.
Edit: There is a new book coming out from the Pragmatic Programmers that specifically addresses unit testing C code which I highly recommend.

They're attached to buttons for placing a bet, and it works fine for placing a bet on the first hand during a game (firing only once); but in betting for the second hand, it fires the click event twice each time a bet or place bet button is pressed (so twice the correct amount is bet for each press).  Overall, it follows this pattern for number of times the click event is fired when pressing a bet button once--where the ith term of the sequence is for the betting of the ith hand from the beginning of the game: 1, 2, 4, 7, 11, 16, 22, 29, 37, 46, which appears to be n(n+1)/2 + 1 for whatever that's worth--and I wasn't smart enough to figure that out, I used OEIS. :)
Here's the function with the click event handlers that are acting up; hopefully it's easy to understand (let me know if not, I want to get better at that as well):
/** The following function keeps track of bet buttons that are pressed, until place button is pressed to place bet. **/

        } else if($(this).attr(""id"") == ""bet5"") { // etc.
            amount = 5;

            player.bet += amount; // add what was just bet by clicking that button to the total bet on this hand
            player.money -= amount; // and, of course, subtract it from player's current pot
            $(""#money"").text(""Money left: $"" + player.money); // then redisplay what the player has left

The point is that in production code you should never want to catch a contract exception; it indicates a bug in your code, so you shouldn't be expecting that any more than arbitrary unexpected exceptions which you may want to catch right at the top of your call stack so you can move onto the next request. Basically you shouldn't view contract exceptions as ones which can be ""handled"" as such.
Now, for testing that's a pain... but do you really want to test your contracts anyway? Isn't that a bit like testing that the compiler stops you from passing in a string to a method which has an int parameter? You've declared the contract, it can be documented appropriately, and enforced appropriately (based on settings, anyway).
If you do want to test contract exceptions, you can either catch a bare Exception in the test and check its full name, or you can mess around with the Contract.ContractFailed event. I would expect unit testing frameworks to have built-in support for this over time - but it'll take a little while to get there. In the meantime you probably want to have a utility method to expect a contract violation. One possible implementation:
const string ContractExceptionName =
    ""System.Diagnostics.Contracts.__ContractsRuntime.ContractException"";

public static void ExpectContractFailure(Action action)
{
    try
    {
        action();

            throw;
        }

Note this code is purely myself messing around with my shiney new copy of Visual Studio, but I'd like to know what I'm doing wrong.
I'm using the professional edition of VS, therefore I do not have static checking. In order to still use code contracts (which I like) I figured the only way my method can work is to catch the exception that is thrown at runtime, but I'm not finding this possible.
TestMethod
[TestMethod, ExpectedException(typeof(System.Diagnostics.Contracts.ContractException))]

Error
Error 1 'System.Diagnostics.Contracts.ContractException' is inaccessible

Edit
After some more thought I've come to the conclusion discussed in the comments, as well as the following. Given a method, if this had a requirement which could be expressed in Code Contract form, I'd write tests as such.
[TestMethod]
[ExpectedException(typeof(ArgumentException))]
public void value_input_must_be_greater_than_zero()
{
    // Arrange
    var person = new Person();
    // Act
    person.Number(-1);
}

This would ensure the contract is part of the code, and will not be removed. This would require the Code Contract to actually throw the specified exception however. In some cases this would not be required however.

If saving changes after each addition DbContext is still nearly two times slower. When it comes to deletion it even gets worse: When saving at the end of all entity removals, DbContext is around 18 times slower than ObjectContext. 
I took my highly developed test application I use to compare database access technologies and a small console application to double check. Both showed bad results for adding and deleting entities using DbContext. Here are the results of the console application:
Inserting 2000 entities via DbContext saving changes at the end: 2164ms
Inserting 2000 entities via ObjectContext saving changes at the end: 457ms
Inserting 2000 entities via DbContext saving changes after each object addition: 8420ms
Inserting 2000 entities via ObjectContext saving changes after each object adding: 4857ms
Inserting 2000 entities via DbContext using a new DbContext for each object addition: 4018ms
Deleting 2000 entities via DbContext saving changes at the end: 4794ms
Deleting 2000 entities via ObjectContext saving changes at the end: 261ms

I tried using EF 4.3 in VC 2010 and EF 5.0 Beta 2 in VS 11 with nearly same results. I used the T4 templates provided by the ""EF 4.x POCO Entity Generator for C#"", the ""EF 4.x DbContext Generator for C#"" and the ""EF 5.x DbContext Generator for C#"".
What could be wrong? According to the test results I would never use DbContext in an application that has to add or delete entities (what makes DbContext unfortunately unusable for me).
I put the console test applications on my web server: EF 4.3 DbContext Test, EF 5.0 DbContext Test

Running the above for different N shows that both behave linearly, but String.format is 5-30 times slower. 
The reason is that in the current implementation String.format first parses the input with regular expressions and then fills in the parameters. Concatenation with plus, on the other hand, gets optimized by javac (not by the JIT) and uses StringBuilder.append directly.

17341945,157882.0,2013-06-27 11:29:45+00:00,17339830,51,"First of all, those starting with facelets. are not JSF context parameters, but Facelets 1.x context parameters. Previously, during JSF 1.x era, Facelets was not integrated as part of JSF. However, since JSF 2.0, Facelets is integrated as part of JSF, replacing legacy JSP as the default view technology, and most of the Facelets 1.x context parameters were remapped to JSF 2.x context parameters. 
The real JSF context parameter names start with javax.faces.. They are listed in chapter 11.1.3 of the JSF specification. Here's an extract of relevance from the JSF 2.0 specification:

11.1.3 Application Configuration Parameters
Servlet containers support application configuration parameters that may be customized by including <context-param> elements in the web application deployment descriptor. All JSF implementations are required to support the following application configuration parameter names:

javax.faces.CONFIG_FILES -- Comma-delimited list of context-relative resource paths under which the JSF implementation will look for application configuration resources (see Section 11.4.4 âApplication Configuration Resource Formatâ), before loading a configuration resource named â/WEB-INF/faces-config.xmlâ (if such a resource exists). If â/WEB-INF/faces-config.xmlâ is present in the list, it must be ignored.
javax.faces.DATETIMECONVERTER_DEFAULT_TIMEZONE_IS_SYSTEM_TIMEZONE -- If this param is set,
  and calling toLowerCase().equals(""true"") on a String representation of its value returns true,
  Application.createConverter() must guarantee that the default for the timezone of all
  javax.faces.convert.DateTimeConverter instances must be equal to TimeZone.getDefault()
  instead of âGMTâ.
javax.faces.DEFAULT_SUFFIX -- Allow the web application to define an alternate suffix for JSP pages
  containing JSF content. See the javadocs for the symbolic constant
  ViewHandler.DEFAULT_SUFFIX_PARAM_NAME for the complete specification.
javax.faces.DISABLE_FACELET_JSF_VIEWHANDLER -- If this param is set, and calling
  toLowerCase().equals(""true"") on a String representation of its value returns true, the default
  ViewHandler must behave as specified in the latest 1.2 version of this specification. Any behavior specified in
  Section 7.5 âViewHandlerâ and implemented in the default ViewHandler that pertains to handling requests for
  pages authored in the JavaServer Faces View Declaration Language must not be executed by the runtime.
javax.faces.FACELETS_LIBRARIES -- If this param is set, the runtime must interpret it as a semicolon (;)
  separated list of paths, starting with â/â (without the quotes). The runtime must interpret each entry in the list as a
  path relative to the web application root and interpret the file found at that path as a facelet tag library, conforming to
  the schema declared in Section 1.1 âXML Schema Definition for Application Configuration Resource fileâand expose
  the tags therein according to Section 10.3.2 âFacelet Tag Library mechanismâ. The runtime must also consider the
  facelets.LIBRARIES param name as an alias to this param name for backwards compatibility with existing
  facelets tag libraries.
javax.faces.FACELETS_BUFFER_SIZE -- The buffer size to set on the response when the ResponseWriter
  is generated. By default the value is -1, which will not assign a buffer size on the response. This should be increased
  if you are using development mode in order to guarantee that the response isn't partially rendered when an error is
  generated. The runtime must also consider the facelets.BUFFER_SIZE param name as an alias to this param
  name for backwards compatibility with existing facelets tag libraries.
javax.faces.DECORATORS -- A semicolon (;) delimitted list of class names of type
  javax.faces.view.facelets.TagDecorator, with a no-argument constructor. These decorators will be
  loaded when the first request for a Facelets VDL view hits the ViewHandler for page compilation.The runtime
  must also consider the facelets.DECORATORS param name as an alias to this param name for backwards
  compatibility with existing facelets tag libraries.
javax.faces.FACELETS_REFRESH_PERIOD -- When a page is requested, what interval in seconds should the
  compiler check for changes. If you don't want the compiler to check for changes once the page is compiled, then use
  a value of -1. Setting a low refresh period helps during development to be able to edit pages in a running
  application.The runtime must also consider the facelets.REFRESH_PERIOD param name as an alias to this
  param name for backwards compatibility with existing facelets tag libraries.
javax.faces.FACELETS_RESOURCE_RESOLVER -- If this param is set, the runtime must interpret its value as a
  fully qualified classname of a java class that extends javax.faces.view.facelets.ResourceResolver
  and has a zero argument public constructor or a one argument public constructor where the type of the argument is
  ResourceResolver. If this param is set and its value does not conform to those requirements, the runtime must
  log a message and continue. If it does conform to these requirements and has a one-argument constructor, the default
  ResourceResolver must be passed to the constructor. If it has a zero argument constructor it is invoked directly.
  In either case, the new ResourceResolver replaces the old one. The runtime must also consider the
  facelets.RESOURCE_RESOLVER param name as an alias to this param name for backwards compatibility with
  existing facelets tag libraries.
javax.faces.FACELETS_SKIP_COMMENTS -- If this param is set, and calling
  toLowerCase().equals(""true"") on a String representation of its value returns true, the runtime must
  ensure that any XML comments in the Facelets source page are not delivered to the client. The runtime must also
  consider the facelets.SKIP_COMMENTS param name as an alias to this param name for backwards compatibility
  with existing facelets tag libraries.
javax.faces.FACELETS_SUFFIX -- Allow the web application to define an alternate suffix for Facelet based
  XHTML pages containing JSF content. See the javadocs for the symbolic constant
  ViewHandler.FACELETS_SUFFIX_PARAM_NAME for the complete specification.
javax.faces.FACELETS_VIEW_MAPPINGS -- If this param is set, the runtime must interpret it as a semicolon
  (;) separated list of strings that is used to forcibly declare that certain pages in the application must be interpreted as
  using Facelets, regardless of their extension. The runtime must also consider the facelets.VIEW_MAPPINGS
  param name as an alias to this param name for backwards compatibility with existing facelets applications. See the
  javadocs for the symbolic constant ViewHandler.FACELETS_VIEW_MAPPINGS_PARAM_NAME for the complete
  specification.
javax.faces.FULL_STATE_SAVING_VIEW_IDS -- The runtime must interpret the value of this parameter as a
  comma separated list of view IDs, each of which must have their state saved using the state saving mechanism
  specified in JSF 1.2.
javax.faces.INTERPRET_EMPTY_STRING_SUBMITTED_VALUES_AS_NULL -- If this param is set, and
  calling toLowerCase().equals(""true"") on a String representation of its value returns true, any
  implementation of UIInput.validate() must take the following additional action.
  If the javax.faces.INTERPRET_EMPTY_STRING_SUBMITTED_VALUES_AS_NULL context parameter value is
  true (ignoring case), and UIInput.getSubmittedValue() returns a zero-length String call
  UIInput.setSubmittedValue(null) and continue processing using null as the current submitted value
javax.faces.LIFECYCLE_ID -- Lifecycle identifier of the Lifecycle instance to be used when processing
  JSF requests for this web application. If not specified, the JSF default instance, identified by
  LifecycleFactory.DEFAULT_LIFECYCLE, must be used.
javax.faces.PARTIAL_STATE_SAVING --The ServletContext init parameter consulted by the runtime to
  determine if the partial state saving mechanism should be used.
  If undefined, the runtime must determine the version level of the application.

For applications versioned at 1.2 and under, the runtime must not use the partial state saving mechanism.
For applications versioned at 2.0 and above, the runtime must use the partial state saving mechanism.

If this parameter is defined, and the application is versioned at 1.2 and under, the runtime must not use the partial
  state saving mechanism. Otherwise, If this param is defined, and calling toLowerCase().equals(""true"") on a String
  representation of its value returns true, the runtime must use partial state mechanism. Otherwise the partial state
  saving mechanism must not be used.
javax.faces.PROJECT_STAGE -- A human readable string describing where this particular JSF application is in
  the software development lifecycle. Valid values are âDevelopmentâ, âUnitTestâ, âSystemTestâ, or
  âProductionâ, corresponding to the enum constants of the class
  javax.faces.application.ProjectStage. It is also possible to set this value via JNDI. See the javadocs
  for Application.getProjectStage().
javax.faces.STATE_SAVING_METHOD -- The location where state information is saved. Valid values are
  âserverâ (typically saved in HttpSession) and âclientâ (typically saved as a hidden field in the subsequent form
  submit). If not specified, the default value âserverâ must be used.
javax.faces.VALIDATE_EMPTY_FIELDS -- If this param is set, and calling
  toLowerCase().equals(""true"") on a String representation of its value returns true, all submitted fields
  will be validated. This is necessary to allow the model validator to decide whether null or empty values are
  allowable in the current application. If the value is false, null or empty values will not be passed to the validators.
  If the value is the string âautoâ, the runtime must check if JSR-303 Beans Validation is present in the current
  environment. If so, the runtime must proceed as if the value âtrueâ had been specified. If JSR-303 Beans Validation
  is not present in the current environment, the runtime most proceed as if the value âfalseâ had been specified. If
  the param is not set, the system must behave as if the param was set with the value âautoâ.
javax.faces.validator.DISABLE_DEFAULT_BEAN_VALIDATOR -- If this param is set, and calling
  toLowerCase().equals(""true"") on a String representation of its value returns true, the runtime must not
  automatically add the validator with validator-id equal to the value of the symbolic constant
  javax.faces.validator.VALIDATOR_ID to the list of default validators. Setting this parameter to true will
  have the effect of disabling the automatic installation of Bean Validation to every input component in every view in
  the application, though manual installation is still possible.

JSF implementations may choose to support additional configuration parameters, as well as additional mechanisms to
  customize the JSF implementation; however, applications that rely on these facilities will not be portable to other JSF
  implementations.

As you can read in the last paragraph, JSF implementations may also have their own set of context parameters. For Mojarra that are the ones starting with com.sun.faces. which are listed on this blog: What Mojarra context parameters are available? For MyFaces that are the ones starting with org.apache.myfaces. which are also listed on their own site: MyFaces documentation - Web Context Parameters.

${string: -3}

or
${string:(-3)}

(mind the space between : and -3 in the first form).
Please refer to the Shell Parameter Expansion in the reference manual:
${parameter:offset}
${parameter:offset:length}

Expands to up to length characters of parameter starting at the character
specified by offset. If length is omitted, expands to the substring of parameter
starting at the character specified by offset. length and offset are arithmetic
expressions (see Shell Arithmetic). This is referred to as Substring Expansion.

If offset evaluates to a number less than zero, the value is used as an offset
from the end of the value of parameter. If length evaluates to a number less than
zero, and parameter is not â@â and not an indexed or associative array, it is
interpreted as an offset from the end of the value of parameter rather than a
number of characters, and the expansion is the characters between the two
offsets. If parameter is â@â, the result is length positional parameters
beginning at offset. If parameter is an indexed array name subscripted by â@â or
â*â, the result is the length members of the array beginning with
${parameter[offset]}. A negative offset is taken relative to one greater than the
maximum index of the specified array. Substring expansion applied to an
associative array produces undefined results.

Note that a negative offset must be separated from the colon by at least one
space to avoid being confused with the â:-â expansion. Substring indexing is
zero-based unless the positional parameters are used, in which case the indexing
starts at 1 by default. If offset is 0, and the positional parameters are used,
$@ is prefixed to the list.


Since this answer gets a few regular views, let me add a possibility to address John Rix's comment; as he mentions, if your string has length less than 3, ${string: -3} expands to the empty string. If, in this case, you want the expansion of string, you may use:
${string:${#string}<3?0:-3}

This uses the ?: ternary if operator, that may be used in Shell Arithmetic; since as documented, the offset is an arithmetic expression, this is valid.

Hash tables are used to quickly store and retrieve data (or records).
Records are stored in buckets using hash keys
Hash keys are calculated by applying a hashing algorithm to a chosen value contained within the record.  This chosen value must be a common value to all the records.
Each bucket can have multiple records which are organized in a particular order.

Real World Example:
Hash & Co., founded in 1803 and lacking any computer technology had a total of 300 filing cabinets to keep the detailed information (the records) for their approximately 30,000 clients.  Each file folder were clearly identified with its unique number from 0 to 299.
The filing clerks of that time had to quickly fetch and store client records for the working staff.  The staff had decided that it would be more efficient to use a hashing methodology to store and retrieve their records.
To file a client record, filing clerks would use the unique client number written on the folder.  Using this client number, they would modulate the hash key by 300 in order to identify the filing cabinet it is contained in.  When they opened the filing cabinet they would discover that it contained many folders ordered by client number.  After identifying the correct location, they would simply slip it in.
To retrieve a client record, filing clerks would be given a client number on a slip of paper.  Using this unique client number, they would modulate it by 300 (the hash key) in order to determine which filing cabinet had the clients folder.  When they opened the filing cabinet they would discover that it contained many folders ordered by client number.  Searching through the records they would quickly find the client folder and retrieve it.
In our real-world example, our buckets are filing cabinets and our records are file folders.

An important thing to remember is that computers (and their algorithms) deal with numbers better than with strings.  So accessing a large array using an index is significantly much faster than accessing sequentially.
As Simon has mentioned which I believe to be very important is that the hashing part is to transform a large space (of arbitrary length, usually strings, etc) and mapping it to a small space (of known size, usually numbers) for indexing.  This if very important to remember!
So in the example above, the 30,000 possible clients or so are mapped to a smaller space.

The main idea in this is to divide your entire data set into segments as to speed up the actual searching which is usually time consuming.  In our example above, each of the 300 filing cabinet would (statistically) contain about 100 records.  Searching (regardless the order) through 100 records is much faster than having to deal with 30,000.
You may have noticed that some actually already do this.  But instead of devising a hashing methodology to generate a hash key, they will in most cases simply use the first letter of the last name.  So if you have 26 filing cabinets each containing a letter from A to Z, you in theory have just segmented your data and enhanced the filing and retrieval process.
Hope this helps,
Jeach!

It's the height of the viewport that shows the website, just the content, no browser's bars.
document.body.clientHeight or $(document).height()
It's the height of your document shown in the viewport. If it is higher than $(window).height() you get the scrollbars to scroll the document.
screen.availHeight
It's the height the browser's window can have if it is maximized, including the browser's bars. So when the window is maximized, screen.availHeight === window.outerHeight
screen.height
It simply matches the screen's resolution. So on a 1920Ã1080 screen, screen.height will be 1080.

It is legal for a compiler to extend this (6.6/10 - An implementation may accept other forms of constant expressions) but that would limit portability.

Keep in mind this is a simplified version of a larger, multi-file project I'm working on.

Since it's an embedded target with limited resources and the struct isn't that small, I don't want multiple copies of the source.  I'd prefer not to use:
#define foo_init { 1, 2, 3 }

I'm also trying to write portable code, so I need a solution that's valid C89 or C99.
Does this have to do with the ORGs in an object file?  That initialized variables go into one ORG and are initialized by copying the contents of a second ORG?
Maybe I'll just need to change my tactic, and have an initializing function do all of the copies at startup.  Unless there are other ideas out there?

If you want to bundle your dependencies into a WAR or EAR file, then simply set the packaging type of your project to EAR or WAR. Maven will bundle the dependencies into the right location.
If you want to create a JAR file that includes your code along with all your dependencies, then use the assembly plugin with the jar-with-dependencies descriptor. Maven will generate a complete JAR file with all your classes plus the classes from any dependencies.
If you want to simply pull your dependencies into the target directory interactively, then use the dependency plugin to copy your files in.
If you want to pull in the dependencies for some other type of processing, then you will probably need to generate your own plugin. There are APIs to get the list of dependencies, and their location on disk. You will have to take it from there...

Does it matter if you looked it up in a book, looked it up on Google, or heard it from a talking frog that you hallucinated?  No.  A right answer is a right answer.

The web.config assumes you are still using the default version of 1.5. There are two things that need to happen to fix it: 
First: Update to the latest versions of Google API and Microsoft Http Client Libraries. You can install the updates via NuGet. Right click on your website, click ""Manage NuGet Packages"", select Updates on the left. At the time of this post some of the Google API's are prerelease only. You can install them via NuGet by selecting ""include prerelease"" on the top left of the update screen. 
Second Update/add a dependentAssembly into your web.config. To do this you need to know the version of the System.Net.HTTP.Primitives.dll that was installed. Look in your bin directory within Windows Explorer. Find System.Net.HTTP.Primitives.dll, right click on it, select properties, and click the ""Details"" tab. Note the version located there.

If you want the input's validation algorithm to allow floating-point values, specify a step accordingly.
For example, I wanted dollar amounts, so I specified a step like this:
 <input type=""number"" name=""price""
           pattern=""[0-9]+([\.,][0-9]+)?"" step=""0.01""
            title=""This should be a number with up to 2 decimal places."">

There's nothing wrong with using jQuery to retrieve the value, but you will find it useful to use the DOM API directly to get the elements's validity.valid property.
I had a similar issue with the decimal point, but the reason I realized there was an issue was because of the styling that Twitter Bootstrap adds to a number input with an invalid value.
Here's a fiddle demonstrating that the adding of the step attribute makes it work, and also testing whether the current value is valid: 

jsFiddle

TL;DR: Set the a step attribute to a floating-point value, because it defaults to 1.
NOTE: The comma doesn't validate for me, but I suspect that if I set my OS language/region settings to somewhere that uses a comma as the decimal separator, it would work. *note in note*: that was not the case for OS language/keyboard settings *German* in Ubuntu/Gnome 14.04.

Currenlty I do not have any solution, how to get float value (as string or number) from input which type is set to number. If enduser enters ""4,55"", Chrome returns always ""455"", Firefox returns ""4,55"" which is fine.

Please remember that cherry-picked or rebased commit is different from the point of view of Git (has different SHA-1 identifier) than the original, so it is different than the commit in remote repository.  (Rebase can usually deal with this, as it checks patch id i.e. the changes, not a commit id).
Also in git you can merge many branches at once: so called octopus merge.  Note that octopus merge has to succeed without conflicts.  Nevertheless it might be useful.

I cherry-pick each commit from the remote (in order). In this case git records the commit as unrelated to the remote branch.
I merge the branch, pulling in all changes, and adding a new ""conflict"" commit (if needed).
I merge each commit from the remote branch individually (again in order), allowing conflicts to be recorded for each commit, instead of grouped all together as one. 
For completeness, you could do a rebase (same as cherry-pick option?), however my understanding is that this can cause confusion for the contributor. Maybe that eliminates option 1.

In both cases 2 and 3, git records the branch history of the commits, unlike 1.

The basic idea is to use signal handlers to set an alarm for some time interval and raise an exception once that timer expires.
Note that this will only work on UNIX.
Here's an implementation that creates a decorator (save the following code as timeout.py).
from functools import wraps
import errno
import os
import signal

class TimeoutError(Exception):
    pass

def timeout(seconds=10, error_message=os.strerror(errno.ETIME)):
    def decorator(func):
        def _handle_timeout(signum, frame):
            raise TimeoutError(error_message)

        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            signal.signal(signal.SIGALRM, _handle_timeout)
            signal.alarm(seconds)
            try:

                signal.alarm(0)
            return result

        return wraps(func)(wrapper)

    return decorator

This creates a decorator called @timeout that can be applied to any long running functions.
So, in your application code, you can use the decorator like so:
from timeout import timeout

# Timeout a long running function with the default expiry of 10 seconds.
@timeout
def long_running_function1():
    ...

# Timeout after 5 seconds
@timeout(5)
def long_running_function2():
    ...

# Timeout after 30 seconds, with the error ""Connection timed out""
@timeout(30, os.strerror(errno.ETIMEDOUT))

For example, the maximum path on drive D is ""D:\some 256-character path string"" where """" represents the invisible terminating null character for the current system codepage. (The characters < > are used here for visual clarity and cannot be part of a valid path string.)

karim79 made a good catch, judging by your element name txtEntry2 may be a textbox, if it's any kind of input, you'll need to use .val() instead or .text() like this:
  $('#txtEntry2').val($(this).find("":selected"").text());

For the ""what's wrong?"" part of the question: .text() doesn't take a selector, it takes text you want it set to, or nothing to return the text already there.  So you need to fetch the text you want, then put it in the .text(string) method on the object you want to set, like I have above.

boolean (true/false) - sets the property value.
function - Is executed for each found element, the returned value is used to set the property. There are two arguments passed; the first argument is the index (0, 1, 2, increases for each found element). The second argument is the current value of the element (true/false).

    return (dec >>> 0).toString(2);
}

Here is the explanation.

-3 >>> 0 (right logical shift) coerces its arguments to unsigned integers, which is why you get the 32-bit two's complement representation of -3.


Added example from barlop- 
(-3 >>> 0).toString(2)

will print   
11111111111111111111111111111101

Further additional point from barlop
I notice that  (3).toString(2) or (3>>>0).toString(2), gives the result of 11, though the correct 2s complement, is 011. 
In 2s complement, positive binary numbers are meant to start with at least one leading zero (more is unnecessary), but they should have at least the one zero.  Negative numbers must start with a 1 (more 1s on the far left are ok but unnecessary).  
So,  (-3>>>0).toString(0) does work for positive or negative, but in the positive case, you may want to add a leading 0 to the far left of the result. You may also want to remove superfluous 1s from the far left of negative numbers, leaving just a single 1.   But really in 2s complement, positive numbers starting with 1 is a 'no no', it's wrong. So for positive numbers, add a leading zero  to that result, if you want technically correct 2s complement. 
EDIT:
(Note added by barlop, to answerer's edit)

The above works fine, but for the sake of commenter ""Magus"", or
  anybody else that is extracting a number from a textbox.  In that
  situation, they will be getting a string and will have to convert that
  to an integer in order to do any arithmetic operation on it. So for
  anybody very new to javascript and getting a their input from a
  textbox, they can use parseInt to convert it, the following example of
  use of parseInt is relevant in that situation.  The function dec2bin
  expects an integer argument dec. So if you have a string you should
  convert it using parseInt(myString, 10).   Here
  and 
  here
  explains why use the second parameter of parseInt function.

6953207,232064.0,2011-08-05 08:01:48+00:00,246930,548,"The simple answer is: no difference, they are the same thing.  Treat them as a 16 byte (128 bits) value that is used as a unique value.  In Microsoft-speak they are called GUIDs, but call them UUIDs when not using Microsoft-speak.
Even the authors of the UUID specification and Microsoft claim they are synonyms:

From the introduction to IETF RFC 4122 ""A Universally Unique IDentifier (UUID) URN Namespace"": ""a Uniform Resource Name namespace for UUIDs (Universally Unique IDentifier), also known as GUIDs (Globally Unique IDentifier).""
From the ITU-T Recommendation X.667, ISO/IEC 9834-8:2004 International Standard: ""UUIDs are also known as Globally Unique Identifiers (GUIDs), but this term is not used in this Recommendation.""
And Microsoft even claims a GUID is specified by the UUID RFC: ""In Microsoft Windows programming and in Windows operating systems, a globally unique identifier (GUID), as specified in [RFC4122], is ... The term universally unique identifier (UUID) is sometimes used in Windows protocol specifications as a synonym for GUID.""

But the correct answer depends on what the question means when it says ""UUID""...
The first part depends on what the asker is thinking when they are saying ""UUID"".
Microsoft's claim implies that all UUIDs are GUIDs. But are all GUIDs real UUIDs? That is, is the set of all UUIDs just a proper subset of the set of all GUIDs, or is it the exact same set?
Looking at the details of the RFC 4122, there are four different ""variants"" of UUIDs.  This is mostly because such 16 byte identifiers were in use before those specifications were brought together in the creation of a UUID specification. From section 4.1.1 of RFC 4122, the four variants of UUID are:

Reserved, Network Computing System backward compatibility
The variant specified in RFC 4122 (of which there are five sub-variants, which are called ""versions"")
Reserved, Microsoft Corporation backward compatibility
Reserved for future definition.

According to RFC 4122, all UUID variants are ""real UUIDs"", then all GUIDs are real UUIDs. To the literal question ""is there any difference between GUID and UUID"" the answer is definitely no for RFC 4122 UUIDs: no difference (but subject to the second part below).
But not all GUIDs are variant 2 UUIDs (e.g. Microsoft COM has GUIDs which are variant 3 UUIDs). If the question was ""is there any difference between GUID and variant 2 UUIDs"", then the answer would be yes -- they can be different. Someone asking the question probably doesn't know about variants and they might be only thinking of variant 2 UUIDs when they say the word ""UUID"" (e.g. they vaguely know of the MAC address+time and the random number algorithms forms of UUID, which are both versions of variant 2). In which case, the answer is yes different.
So the answer, in part, depends on what the person asking is thinking when they say the word ""UUID"". Do they mean variant 2 UUID (because that is the only variant they are aware of) or all UUIDs?
The second part depends on which specification being used as the definition of UUID.
If you think that was confusing, read the ITU-T X.667 ISO/IEC 9834-8:2004 which is supposed to be aligned and fully technically compatible with RFC 4122.  It has an extra sentence in Clause 11.2 that says, ""All UUIDs conforming to this Recommendation | International Standard shall have variant bits with bit 7 of octet 7 set to 1 and bit 6 of octet 7 set to 0"". Which means that only variant 2 UUID conform to that Standard (those two bit values mean variant 2). If that is true, then not all GUIDs are conforming ITU-T/ISO/IEC UUIDs, because conformant ITU-T/ISO/IEC UUIDs can only be variant 2 values.
Therefore, the real answer also depends on which specification of UUID the question is asking about. Assuming we are clearly talking about all UUIDs and not just variant 2 UUIDs: there is no difference between GUID and IETF's UUIDs, but yes difference between GUID and conforming ITU-T/ISO/IEC's UUIDs!
Binary encodings could differ
When encoded in binary (as opposed to the human-readable text format), the GUID may be stored in a structure with four different fields as follows. This format differs from the UUID standard only in the byte order of the first 3 fields.
Bits  Bytes Name   Endianness  Endianness

In addition, select-layout may be used to apply a previously used layout -

suitable for use with select-layout.  For example:

       $ tmux select-layout bb62,159x48,0,0{79x48,0,0,79x48,80,0}

 tmux automatically adjusts the size of the layout for the current window
 size.  Note that a layout cannot be applied to a window with more panes
 than that from which the layout was originally defined.

First set up your layout just how you like it - you can adjust widths with resize-pane until it is just right for you. Then run tmux list-windows. And then you should be able to use the layout: line from the output unaltered in tmuxinator.conf

In situations where it's the first thing I write, I almost always at least try to refactor it into something clearer. Sometimes it can't be helped (or the alternative is to have a bool variable which does nothing meaningful except indicate the end of the loop, less clearly than a break statement) but it's worth at least trying.
As an example of where it's clearer to use break than a flag, consider:
while (true)
{
    doStuffNeededAtStartOfLoop();
    int input = getSomeInput();
    if (testCondition(input))
    {
        break;
    }
    actOnInput(input);
}

Now let's force it to use a flag:
boolean running = true;
while (running)
{
    doStuffNeededAtStartOfLoop();
    int input = getSomeInput();
    if (testCondition(input))
    {
        running = false;
    }
    else
    {
        actOnInput(input);
    }
}

I view the latter as more complicated to read: it's got an extra else block, the actOnInput is more indented, and if you're trying to work out what happens when testCondition returns true, you need to look carefully through the rest of the block to check that there isn't something after the else block which would occur whether running has been set to false or not.
The break statement communicates the intent more clearly, and lets the rest of the block get on with what it needs to do without worrying about earlier conditions.
Note that this is exactly the same sort of argument that people have about multiple return statements in a method. For example, if I can work out the result of a method within the first few lines (e.g. because some input is null, or empty, or zero) I find it clearer to return that answer directly than to have a variable to store the result, then a whole block of other code, and finally a return statement.

} while(true)

Now for my test I'm just scanning for some console input, but I was told that this kind of loop is discouraged because using break is akin to goto, we just don't do it.
I understand fully the pitfalls of goto and its Java cousin break:label, and I have the good sense not to use them. I also realize that a more complete program would provide some other means of escape, say for instance to just end the program, but that wasn't a reason my professor cited, so...

So, should EnumSet.allOf be more preferable to Enum.values?

  return function(e:MouseEvent):void {
    trace(""Received "" + b + "", "" + i + "", "" + n + "" and "" + s + ""."");
  };
}

But most importantly, you will very likely need to remove the listener later to free resources, so +1 line to store it in a variable:
var functionOnClick:Function = onClick(true, 123, 4.56, ""string"");
stage.addEventListener(MouseEvent.CLICK, functionOnClick);
function onClick(b:Boolean, i:int, n:Number, s:String):Function {
  return function(e:MouseEvent):void {
    trace(""Received "" + b + "", "" + i + "", "" + n + "" and "" + s + ""."");

}

And you'll be able to remove it normally:
trace(""Before: "" + stage.hasEventListener(MouseEvent.CLICK));
stage.removeEventListener(MouseEvent.CLICK, functionOnClick);
trace(""After: "" + stage.hasEventListener(MouseEvent.CLICK));


Here's a more elaborated, dynamic example to prove its use:
function onClick(s:String):Function {
  return function(e:MouseEvent):void {
    trace(""The square "" + s + "" at x = "" + e.currentTarget.x + ""px was clicked"");
  };
}
var myFunctions:Array = new Array();
for (var i:int = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  myFunctions.push(onClick(""#"" + (i+1)));
}
for (i = 0; i < myFunctions.length; i++) {
  var square:Sprite = new Sprite();
  square.name = ""sqr"" + i;
  square.addChild(new Bitmap(new BitmapData(20, 20, false, 0)));
  square.x = 5 + 25 * i;
  square.addEventListener(MouseEvent.CLICK, myFunctions[i]);
  stage.addChild(square);
}

No properties through dynamic objects, no custom class, no loose functions, no scope overlap. Just what logic expects it to be: you're simply passing arguments to it.
And to remove every listener properly, you can do it like this later:
for (i = 0; i < myFunctions.length; i++) {
  square = stage.getChildByName(""sqr"" + i) as Sprite;
  trace(""Before (#"" + (i+1) + ""): "" + square.hasEventListener(MouseEvent.CLICK));
  square.removeEventListener(MouseEvent.CLICK, myFunctions[i]);
  trace(""After (#"" + (i+1) + ""): "" + square.hasEventListener(MouseEvent.CLICK));
  stage.removeChild(square);
}

For many years (3~4), on every website, forum, blog, wherever I searched, people tell me there's no simple way to do this. They usually suggest to:

Add the listener to a dynamic object, where you can set the value to an extra property and reference it (e.target.property / e.currentTarget.property) in the function.
Not all classes are dynamic. It won't work on a Sprite, for example.
Extend the class of the object with a custom class to add property or to just make it dynamic.
You'll have to create a whole new tweak class everytime.
Use an anonymous function as the event handler.
There's no reference (and it's ugly). To remove the listener to free resources you're forced to do it from inside the function itself with arguments.callee.
Call another function, using the parameter, inside the event handler.
And where in the event handler call does the parameter go?
Keep the event handler in the same scope as the parameter.
Breach to a total semantic mess.
Encapsulate both event handler definition and addEventListener call in a function receiving the target and parameters.
It can mix scopes, but it's a close one. You have to be careful, though.

...Among many other suggested workarounds.
All I want is just to pass an argument to the event handler so I can use it inside its function, just like any normal function!

7211695,94102.0,2011-08-27 00:16:59+00:00,4583950,65,"Okay, let's go through one by one:

I'm looking to extract pitches from a sound signal.

Although I am not an expert and have had minimal formal training, I think I know the best answer to this problem.  I've done a lot of searching, reading, and experimenting over the past few years.  My consensus is that the autocorrelation method is by far the best pitch detector in terms of the tradeoff between accuracy, complexity, noise robustness, and speed.  Unless you have some very specific circumstances, I would almost always recommend using autocorrelation.  More on this later, let me answer your other questions.
What you describe is ""cepstral analysis""  which is a method mainly used for the extraction of pitch from speech.  Cepstral analysis relies entirely on the plentifulness and strength of the overtones of your signal.  If for example, you were to pass a pure sine wave through cepstral analysis, you would get terrible results.  However, for speech, which is a complex signal, there is a large number of overtones.  (overtones, by the way, are elements of the signal which are oscillating at multiples of the fundamental frequency i.e. the pitch we perceive).  Cepstral analysis can be robust in detecting speech with a missing fundamental frequency.  That is, suppose you plotted the function sin(4x)+sin(6x)+sin(8x)+sin(10x).  If you look at that, it is clear that it has the same frequency as the function sin(2x).  However, if you apply fourier analysis to this function, the bin corresponding to sin(2x) will have zero magnitude.  Thus this signal is consider to have a ""missing fundamental frequency"", because it does not contain the sinusoid of the frequency which we consider it to be.  Thus simply picking the biggest peak on the fourier transform will not work on this signal.

I have previously used a technique which scours the frequency bins of
  a single FFT for local maxima. when it encounters one, it uses a
  cunning technique (the change in phase since the last FFT) to more
  accurately place the actual peak within the bin.

What you are describing is the phase vocoder technique to more accurately measure the frequency of a given partial.  However, the basic technique of picking out the biggest bin is going to cause you problems if you use a signal with a missing or weak fundamental frequency component.

I am worried that this precision will be lost with this technique I'm presenting here.

First of all, remember that the phase vocoder technique only more accurately measures the frequency of a single partial.  It ignores the information contained in the higher partials about the fundamental frequency.  Second of all, given a decent FFT size, you can get very good accuracy using peak interpolation.  Someone else here has pointed you towards parabolic interpolation.  I also would suggest this. 
If you parabolically interpolate the FFT of a 4098 sample block of data at 44100 Hz,  with a pitch about 440 hz, that will mean it will be between the 40th (430.66 Hz) and 41st (441.430664064) bin.  Assuming this paper is approximately correct in the general case, it says parabolic interpolation increases resolution by more than one order of magnitude.  This leaves the resolution at at least 1 Hz, which is the threshold of human hearing.  In fact, if you use an ideal Gaussian window, parabolic interpolation is exact at the peaks (That's right, exact.  remember, however, that you can never use a true Gaussian window, because it extends forever in both directions.)  If you are still worried about getting higher accuracy, you can always pad the FFT.  This means adding zeros to the end of the FFT before transforming.  It works out that this is equivalent to ""sinc interpolation"" which is the ideal interpolation function for frequency limited signals.

I guess the technique could be used after the second FFT to get the fundamental accurately. But it kind of looks like the information is lost in step 2.

That is correct.  The phase vocoder technique relies on the fact that sequential frames are connected and have a specific phase relationship.  However, the log magnitude of the FFT of sequential frames does not show the same relationship in terms of phase, thus it would be useless to use this transform for the second FFT.


does this approach makes sense? Can it be improved?


Yes and yes, I will elaborate on the improvement in my bit on autocorrelation at the end.


I'm a bit worried about And the log square component; there seems to be a vDSP function to do exactly that: vDSP_vdbcon however, there is no indication it precalculates a log-table -- I assume it doesn't, as the FFT function requires an explicit pre-calculation function to be called and passed into it. and this function doesn't.


I don't know the specifics of the vDSP library, sorry.


Is there some danger of harmonics being picked up? 


In your original phase-vocoder peak picking technique? yes.  With the cepstral method? no, not really, the whole point is that it considers all the harmonics to get its frequency estimate.  For exmaple, let's say our freqency is 1.  Our overtones are 2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,etc  We would have to take out all of the odd harmonics, i.e. leave 2,4,6,8, etc, and remove the fundamental frequency before it would start to be confused with one of its overtones.


is there any cunning way of making vDSP pull out the maxima, biggest first?


Don't know vDSP, but in the general case, you usually just iterate over all of them and keep track of the biggest.


Can anyone point me towards some research or literature on this technique?


The link P. i gave you in a comment seemed like a good one.  
Also, this website offers an incredibly in-depth and wonderfully broad explanation of DSP topics, including all sorts of pitch extraction, manipulation, etc, in both a theoretical and practical way.  (this is a more general link to an index on the site).  I always find myself coming back to it.  Sometimes it can be a bit overwhelming if you jump into the middle of it, but you can always follow every explanation back to the basic building blocks.
Now for autocorrelation.  Basically the technique is this:  You take your (windowed) signal and time delay it different amounts.  Find the amount which matches up best with your original signal.  That is the fundamental period.   It makes a lot of theoretical sense.  You are hunting for the repetitive parts of your signal.  
In practice, taking the correlation with all these time delayed copies of the signal is slow.  It is usually implemented in this way instead (which is mathematically equivalent):
Zero-Pad it to double its original length.Take the FFT.  Then replace all the coefficients with their square magnitude, except for the first, which you set to 0.  Now take the IFFT.  Divide every element by the first one.  This gives you the autocorrelation. Mathematically, you are using the circular convolution theorem (look it up), and using zero-padding to convert a linear convolution problem into a circular convolution one, which can be efficiently solved.
However, be careful about picking the peak.  For very small delays, the signal will match up with itself very well, simply because it is continuous.  (I mean, if you delay it zero, it correlates perfectly with itself) Instead, pick the largest peak after the first zero-crossing.  You can parabolically interpolate the autocorrelation function as well just as with other techniques to get much more accurate values.
This by itself will give you very good pitch detection by all criteria  However, you might sometimes encounter a problem with pitch halving and pitch doubling.  Basically the problem is that if a signal is repetitive every 1 second, it is also repetitive every two seconds.  Similarly, if it has a very strong overtone, you might get pitch halving.  So the biggest peak might not always be the one you want.  A solution to this problem is the MPM algorithm by Phillip McLeod.  The idea is this: 
Instead of picking the biggest peak, you want to pick the first peak that is large enough to be considered.  How do you determine if a peak is large enough to be considered?  If it is at least as high as A*the largest peak, where A is some constant.  Phillip suggests a value of A around 0.9 I think.   Actually the program he wrote, Tartini, allows you to compare several different pitch detection algorithms in real time.  I would strongly suggest downloading it and trying it out (it implements Cepstrum, straight autocorrelation, and MPM): (if you have trouble building, try the instructions here. 
One last thing I should note is about windowing.  In general, any smooth window will do.  Hanning window, Hamming window, etc.  Hopefully you should know how to window.  I would also suggest doing overlapped windows if you want more accurate temporal measurements.
By the way, a cool property of the autocorrelation is that if the frequency is changing linearly through the windowed section you are measuring, it will give you the correct frequency at the center of the window.
One more thing:  What I described is called the biased autocorrelation function.  This is because for higher time lags, the overlap between the original signal and the time lagged version becomes less and less.  For example, if you look at a window of size N which has been delayed N-1 samples, you see that only one sample overlaps.  So the correlation at this delay is clearly going to be very close to zero.  You can compensate for this, by diving each value of the autocorrelation function by the number of samples overlap to get it.  This is called the unbiased autocorrelation.  However, in general, you will get worse results with this, as the higher delay values of the autocorrelation are very noisy, as they are based on only a few samples, so it makes sense to weigh them less.
If you're looking for more information, as always, google is your friend.  Good search terms: autocorrelation, pitch detection, pitch tracking, pitch extraction, pitch estimation, cepstrum, etc.

I am attempting this using vDSP
I can't understand how I didn't come across this technique earlier. I did a lot of hunting and asking questions; several weeks worth.  More to the point, I can't understand why I didn't think of it.
I am attempting to achieve this with vDSP library.  It looks as though it has functions to handle all of these tasks.
However, I'm wondering about the accuracy of the final result.
I have previously used a technique which  scours the frequency bins of a single FFT for local maxima.  When it encounters one, it uses a cunning technique (the change in phase since the last FFT) to more accurately place the actual peak within the bin.

I guess the technique could be used after the second FFT to get the fundamental accurately. But it kind of looks like the information is lost in step 2.
As this is a potentially tricky process, could someone with some experience just look over what I'm doing and check it for sanity?
Also, I've heard there is an alternative technique involving fitting a quadratic over neighbouring bins. Is this of comparable accuracy?  If so, I would favour it, as it doesn't involve remembering bin phases.
So, questions:

does this approach makes sense? Can it be improved?

Notice how the static constructor invokes the method desiredAssertionStatus on the Class object and sets the class-wide variable $assertionsDisabled; also notice that in onCreate(), all of the code to throw java.lang.AssertionError is compiled in, but its execution is contingent upon the value of $assertionsDisabled which is set for the Class object in the static constructor.
It appears that JUnit's Assert class is what is used predominantly, so it is likely a safe bet to use that. The flexibility of the assert keyword is the ability to turn on assertions at development time and turn them off for shipping bits and instead fail gracefully.
Hope this helps.

Is there a better way to implement this now with Recyclerview now?

Yes.
When you use a RecyclerView, you need to specify a LayoutManager that is responsible for laying out each item in the view. The LinearLayoutManager allows you to specify an orientation, just like a normal LinearLayout would.
To create a horizontal list with RecyclerView, you might do something like this:
LinearLayoutManager layoutManager
    = new LinearLayoutManager(this, LinearLayoutManager.HORIZONTAL, false);

RecyclerView myList = (RecyclerView) findViewById(R.id.my_recycler_view);
myList.setLayoutManager(layoutManager);

I have installed rails 3 on ruby 1.9.2p136, which is ok i guess. But i cannot start rails console and it gives me the error i copied. The apps worked great with ruby 1.8.7 and i never saw an error like this.
Any ideas what it could be?

Let's say you have a Python datetime object, d, created with datetime.now(). Its value is:
datetime.datetime(2011, 5, 25, 13, 34, 5, 787000)

You can serialize it to JSON as an ISO 8601 datetime string:
import json    
json.dumps(d.isoformat())

The example datetime object would be serialized as:
'""2011-05-25T13:34:05.787000""'

This value, once received in the Javascript layer, can construct a Date object:
var d = new Date(""2011-05-25T13:34:05.787000"");

As of Javascript 1.8.5, Date objects have a toJSON method, which returns a string in a standard format. To serialize the above Javascript object back to JSON, therefore, the command would be:
d.toJSON()

Which would give you:
'2011-05-25T20:34:05.787Z'

This string, once received in Python, could be deserialized back to a datetime object:
datetime.strptime('2011-05-25T20:34:05.787Z', '%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S.%fZ')

This results in the following datetime object, which is the same one you started with and therefore correct:
datetime.datetime(2011, 5, 25, 20, 34, 5, 787000)

// clear, because eof or other bits may be still set.

Which has done the thing for both input and output stringstreams. Alternatively, you can manually clear, then seek the appropriate sequence to the begin:
s.clear();
s.seekp(0); // for outputs: seek put ptr to start
s.seekg(0); // for inputs: seek get ptr to start

That will prevent some reallocations done by str by overwriting whatever is in the output buffer currently instead. Results are like this:
std::ostringstream s;
s << ""hello"";
s.seekp(0);
s << ""b"";
assert(s.str() == ""bello"");

If you want to use the string for c-functions, you can use std::ends, putting a terminating null like this:
std::ostringstream s;
s << ""hello"";
s.seekp(0);
s << ""b"" << std::ends;
assert(s.str().size() == 5 && std::strlen(s.str().data()) == 1);

std::ends is a relict of the deprecated std::strstream, which was able to write directly to a char array you allocated on the stack. You had to insert a terminating null manually. However, std::ends is not deprecated, i think because it's still useful as in the above cases.

 */
public static <T> Future<T> waitForAny(Collection<Future<T>> futures) 
        throws AllFuturesFailedException

Is there anything like this? Or anything similar, not necessary for Future. Currently I loop through collection of futures, check if one is finished, then sleep for some time and check again. This looks like not the best solution, because if I sleep for long period then unwanted delay is added, if I sleep for short period then it can affect performance.
I could try using 
new CountDownLatch(1)

and decrease countdown when task is complete and do 
countdown.await()

, but I found it possible only if I control Future creation. It is possible, but requires system redesign, because currently logic of tasks creation (sending Callable to ExecutorService) is separated from decision to wait for which Future. I could also override 
<T> RunnableFuture<T> AbstractExecutorService.newTaskFor(Callable<T> callable)

and create custom implementation of RunnableFuture with ability to attach listener to be notified when task is finished, then attach such listener to needed tasks and use CountDownLatch, but that means I have to override newTaskFor for every ExecutorService I use - and potentially there will be implementation which do not extend AbstractExecutorService. I could also try wrapping given ExecutorService for same purpose, but then I have to decorate all methods producing Futures.
All these solutions may work but seem very unnatural. It looks like I'm missing something simple, like 
WaitHandle.WaitAny(WaitHandle[] waitHandles)

in c#. Are there any well known solutions for such kind of problem?
UPDATE:
Originally I did not have access to Future creation at all, so there were no elegant solution. After redesigning system I got access to Future creation and was able to add countDownLatch.countdown() to execution process, then I can countDownLatch.await() and everything works fine.
Thanks for other answers, I did not know about ExecutorCompletionService and it indeed can be helpful in similar tasks, but in this particular case it could not be used because some Futures are created without any executor - actual task is sent to another server via network, completes remotely and completion notification is received.

These developments which you might need (user authentication, message system, asset handlers, geolocation, pagination system, linking to exterior services such as Amazon AWS, and last but not least Rails itself) are called Ruby Gems. These are ruby software packages, not necessarily relating to Rails, but since Rails is based on Ruby, 98% of the gems can be made availble to your Rails webapp code.
Lots of gems can be found in github, but its funner to search for gems via ruby-gems or ruby-toolbox 
Your gemfile is a list of all gems that you want to include in the project.
It is used with bundler (also a gem) to install, update, remove and otherwise manage your used gems.
The gemfile has another purpose - you can group gems in :development, :test, :assets, :production, etc groups and Rails will know when to include the gems. For example:
group :development, :test do
    gem ""rspec-rails""
    gem ""factory_girl_rails""
    gem ""guard-rspec""
end

Note that on Rails 4, the assets group has been deprecated 
These gems belong to development environment and the test environment since they are for testing the application. You don't need them available in the production environment (you could, but that will bloat the memory unnecessarily).
So - To use the gemfile, simply write the gem you wish to install such as
gem 'devise'

make sure to install bundler beforehand (in your console/cmd/ssh) with 
$ gem install bundler

and then write in the console
bundle install

you will notice another gemfile appears! Gemfile.lock 
This file, as you will see if you open it with a text reader, lists all your gems with their version and their dependencies. This will come useful when you need to know which versions of the gems you installed.
For more reading on the Gemfile - read on the bundler page
for information regarding picking a gem you could start with this
Good luck and have fun!

Ok, so whats this Gemfile.lock that got created?
Gemfile.lock, as the name suggests is a locking on all the versions of all the gems that got installed. So if Gemfile is what required to be installed, the lock file is what got installed and what version are actually required to get the app up and running.
If you don't have the gems in that specific version (as specified in Gemfile.lock) rails will complain and you will have to either install the missing gems (via bundle install) or fix any conflicts manually (I believe bundler will give you some clues on that)
Some things to know about Gemfile.lock

if you accidently delete it, it will get regenerated when you run bundle install. If you accidently delete Gemfile, you are out of luck.. You should use git :)
Heroku doesn't care about Gemfile.lock since it will reinstall all gems. So for Heroku, you must set the gem version you want, or Heroku will always install the latest version of gem, which may cause issues
Keep the Gemfile.lock in your project so you will always know what version of gems make your app work properly.

To me, the biggest advantage is that:

it has a version of emacsclient that starts the Emacs server if no server is running (open all your files in the same Emacs window)
it includes several useful packages such as Nxml
it has a Windows installer or you can build it from sources

And concerning XEmacs, according to this post by Steve Yegge:

To summarize, I've argued that XEmacs has a much lower market share, poorer performance, more bugs, much lower stability, and at this point probably fewer features than GNU Emacs. When you add it all up, it's the weaker candidate by a large margin.

Regardless of what the Gson documentation says, if your class doesn't have an no-args constructor and you have not registered any InstanceCreater objects, then it will create an ObjectConstructor (which constructs your Object) with an UnsafeAllocator which uses Reflection to get the allocateInstance method of the class sun.misc.Unsafe to create your class' instance.
This Unsafe class goes around the lack of no-args constructor and has many other dangerous uses. allocateInstance states

Allocate an instance but do not run any constructor. Initializes the
  class if it has not yet been.

So it doesn't actually need a constructor and will go around your two argument constructor. See some examples here.
If you do have a no-args constructor, Gson will use an ObjectConstructor which uses that default Constructor by calling
yourClassType.getDeclaredConstructor(); // ie. empty, no-args

My 2 cents: Follow what Gson says and create your classes with a no-arg constructor or register an InstanceCreator. You might find yourself in a bad position using Unsafe.

Even more, in the javadoc on Gson's InstanceCreator class said that exception will be thrown if we try to deserialize instance of class missing default constructor and we should use InstanceCreator in such cases. However, I've tried to test use Gson with class lacking default constructor and both serialization and deserialization work without any trouble.
Here is the piece of code for deserializaiton. A class without non-args constructor:
public class Mushroom {
    private String name;
    private double diameter;

    public Mushroom(String name, double diameter) {
        this.name = name;
        this.diameter = diameter;
    }

    //equals(), hashCode(), etc.
}

and a test:
@Test
public void deserializeMushroom() {
    assertEquals(
            new Mushroom(""Fly agaric"", 4.0),
            new Gson().fromJson(
                    ""{name:\""Fly agaric\"", diameter:4.0}"", Mushroom.class));
}

which works fine.
So my question is: could I actually use Gson without need to have default constructor or there is any circumstances when it will not work?

In other words, if someone looks at another application or takes a phone call, then switches back to your app which was earlier on backgrounded, your UIViewController which was already visible when you left your app 'doesn't care' so to speak -- as far as it is concerned, it's never disappeared and it's still visible -- and so viewWillAppear isn't called.
I recommend against calling the viewWillAppear yourself -- it has a specific meaning which you shouldn't subvert! A refactoring you can do to achieve the same effect might be as follows:
- (void)viewWillAppear:(BOOL)animated {
    [self doMyLayoutStuff:self];
}

- (void)doMyLayoutStuff:(id)sender {

There's no out of the box way to tell which is the 'current' UIViewController by the way.

You could use such a thing to track the latest UIViewController which has been presented.

Mark the object disposed so that future accidental usage of the object will throw an exception.
Possibly1 release references to managed objects, which can make the GC's job a bit easier depending on the GC implementation.  (On today's GC algorithms it makes no real difference, so this is a point for an academic discussion and has no significant real-world impact.)

MemoryStream does not have any unmanaged resources to dispose, so you don't technically have to dispose of it.  The effect of not disposing a MemoryStream is roughly the same thing as dropping a reference to a byte[] -- the GC will clean both up the same way.

Which one do I call?  Is it necessary to call both?

The Dispose() method of streams delegate directly to the Close() method2, so both do exactly the same thing.

Will the other throw an exception if I have already called one of them?

The documentation for IDisposable.Dispose() specifically states it is safe to call Dispose() multiple times, on any object3.  (If that is not true for a particular class then that class implements the IDisposable interface in a way that violates its contract, and this would be a bug.)
All that to say: it really doesn't make a huge difference whether you dispose a MemoryStream or not.  The only real reason it has Close/Dispose methods is because it inherits from Stream, which requires those methods as part of its contract to support streams that do have unmanaged resources (such as file or socket descriptors).

By default, the OpenSSL::X509::Store used for making the connection doesn't use any trusted certificates at all. Based on your knowledge of the application domain, you would typically feed an instance of X509::Store with the trusted certificate(s) that are relevant for your application. There are several options for this:

Store#add_file takes a path to a PEM/DER-encoded certificate
Store#add_cert takes an instance of X509::Certificate
Store#add_path takes a path to a directory where trusted certificates can be found 

The ""Browser"" Approach
This is in contrast to the approach browsers, Java (cacerts), or Windows with its own internal store of trusted certificates, take. There the software is pre-equipped with a set of trusted certificates that is considered to be ""good"" in the opinion of the software vendor. Generally this is not a bad idea, but if you actually look into these sets, then you will soon notice that there are just too many certificates. An individual can't really tell whether all of these certificates should be trusted blindly or not. 
The Ruby Approach
The requirements of your typical Ruby application on the other hand are a lot different than that of a browser. A browser must be be able to let you navigate to any ""legitimate"" web site that comes with a TLS certificate and is served over https. But in a typical Ruby application you will only have to deal with a few services that use TLS or would otherwise require certificate validation. 
And there is the benefit of the Ruby approach - although it requires more manual work, you will end up with a hand-tailored solution that exactly trusts the certificates it should trust in your given application context. This is tedious, but security is much higher this way because you expose a lot less attack surface. Take recent events: if you never had to include DigiNotar or any other compromised root in your trust set, then there's no way such breaches can affect you.
The downside of this, however, as you have already noticed, is that by default, if you don't actively add trusted certificates, the OpenSSL extension will not be able to validate any peer certificate at all. In order to make things work, you have to set up the configuration manually. 
This inconvenience has led to a lot of dubious measures to circumvent it, the worst of all being to globally set OpenSSL::SSL::VERIFY_PEER = OpenSSL::SSL::VERIFY_NONE. Please don't do this. We have even made jokes about adding code that lets your application crash randomly if we encounter that hack :)
If manual trust setup seems too complicated, I'll offer an easy alternative now that makes the OpenSSL extension behave exactly the same as OpenSSL CLI commands like s_client.
Why s_client can verify the certificate
OpenSSL uses a similar approach to browsers and Windows. A typical installation will put a bundle of trusted certificates somewhere on your hard disk (something like /etc/ssl/certs/ca-bundle.crt) and this will serve as the default set of trusted certificates. That's where s_client looks when it needs to verify peer certificates and that's why your experiment succeeded.
Making Ruby act like s_client
If you'd still like to have the same comfort when validating certificates with Ruby, you can tell it to use the OpenSSL bundle of trusted certificates if available on your system by calling OpenSSL::X509::Store#set_default_paths. Additional information can be found here. To use this with XMLRPC::Client, simply ensure that set_default_paths gets called on the X509::Store it uses.
",9199660,95114.0,2012-02-08 18:56:06+00:00,,43,Why is Ruby unable to verify an SSL certificate?,"This is my first time trying to use the XMLRPC::Client library to interact with a remote API and I keep receiving this error:
warning: peer certificate won't be verified in this SSL session

Searching around I've found loads of people that have gotten that error. Usually it's with self-signed certificates and they just want it to go away, so they do something dirty like monkey patch the way XMLRPC::Client is opening it's http session.
I first assumed this was simply the client not caring whether the certificate was valid or not, so I continued my search and came across this gem. It simply forces verification of all SSL certificates and throws a hard error if it's not able too. This was exactly what I wanted. I included it, ran the code again and now I'm getting this:
OpenSSL:SSL::SSLError:
  SSL_connect returned=1 errno=0 state=SSLv3 read server certificate B:
  certificate verify failed

Of course! The certificate is bad! But I double check just to make sure with openssl's builtin s_client like so:
openssl s_client -connect sub.example.com:443

and what do I get:
CONNECTED(00000003)
---
Certificate chain
<snip>
Verify return code: 0 (ok)

So now we get to my question. OpenSSL (the command line version) says the certificate is good. OpenSSL (the Ruby library) disagrees. All of my web browsers say the certificate is good.
A few additional details that might be of use. The certificate is a wildcard but is valid for the domain. The openssl s_client was run on the same machine seconds apart from the Ruby code. This is Ruby 1.8.7 p357 which is installed with RVM.
Does Ruby use something other than the CA bundle provided by the host OS? Is there a way to tell Ruby to use a specific CA bundle or the system one?

Instead, since an NSInvocation object will allow you to pass arguments; an NSInvocation object is, as the docs define it:

an Objective-C message rendered static, that is, it is an action turned into an object.

Whilst creating an NSTimer object using a selector requires the format of the method being:
- (void)timerFireMethod:(NSTimer*)theTimer

An NSInvocation allows you to set the target, the selector, and the arguments that you pass in:
SEL selector = @selector(myMethod:setValue2:);

NSInvocation *invocation = [NSInvocation invocationWithMethodSignature:signature];

//Set the arguments
[invocation setTarget:targetInstance];
[invocation setArgument:&str1 atIndex:2];
[invocation setArgument:&str2 atIndex:3];

Where MyObject is the class that myMethod:setValue2: is declared and implemented on â instanceMethodSignatureForSelector: is a convenience function declared on NSObject which returns an NSMethodSignature object for you, to be passed to NSInvocation.
Also, to note, with setArgument:atIndex:, the indices for arguments to be passed to the method set as the selector start at index 2. From the docs:

10204449,157247.0,2012-04-18 07:00:11+00:00,10204420,63,"Yes, what you have there is right. Some notes:

bar is created on every call to the function, but:


On modern browsers this is a very fast process. (Some engines may well only compile the code for it once, and then reuse that code with a different context each time; Google's V8 engine [in Chrome and elsewhere] does that in most cases.)
And depending on what bar does, some engines may determine that they can ""inline"" it, eliminating the function call entirely. V8 does this, and I'm sure it's not the only engine that does. Naturally they can only do this if it doesn't change the behavior of the code.

The performance impact, if any, of having bar created every time will vary widely between JavaScript engines. If bar is trivial, it will vary from undetectable to fairly small. If you're not calling foo thousands of times in a row (for instance, from a mousemove handler), I wouldn't worry about it. Even if you are, I'd only worry about it if I saw a problem on slower engines. Here's a test case involving DOM operations, which suggests that there is an impact, but a trivial one (probably washed out by the DOM stuff). Here's a test case doing pure computation which shows a much higher impact, but frankly even, we're talking a difference of microseconds because even a 92% increase on something that takes microseconds to happen is still very, very fast. Until/unless you saw a real-world impact, it's not something to worry about.
bar will only be accessible from within the function, and it has access to all variables and arguments for that call to the function. This makes this a very handy pattern.
Note that because you've used a function declaration, it doesn't matter where you put the declaration (top, bottom, or middle — as long as it's at the top level of the function, not inside a flow control statement, which is a syntax error), it gets defined before the first line of step-wise code is run.

I have a function whose structure is similar to the above. I want to abstract task 3 into a function, bar(), but I wish to limit the access of this function to only within the scope of foo(a).
To achieve what I want, is it right to change to the following?
function foo(a) {
    function bar() {
        // perform task 3
    }

If the above is correct, does bar() get redefined every time foo(a) gets called? (worrying about waste of cpu resource here)

14696336,1887090.0,2013-02-04 21:53:20+00:00,14694810,173,"I've had to deal with this recently, and here's what I ended up doing to get SVM to work for images.
To train your SVM on a set of images, first you have to construct the training matrix for the SVM. This matrix is specified as follows: each row of the matrix corresponds to one image, and each element in that row corresponds to one feature of the class -- in this case, the color of the pixel at a certain point. Since your images are 2D, you will need to convert them to a 1D matrix. The length of each row will be the area of the images (note that the images must be the same size).
Let's say you wanted to train the SVM on 5 different images, and each image was 4x3 pixels. First you would have to initialize the training matrix. The number of rows in the matrix would be 5, and the number of columns would be the area of the image, 4*3 = 12.
int num_files = 5;
int img_area = 4*3;
Mat training_mat(num_files,img_area,CV_32FC1);

Ideally, num_files and img_area wouldn't be hardcoded, but obtained from looping through a directory and counting the number of images and taking the actual area of an image.
The next step is to ""fill in"" the rows of training_mat with the data from each image. Below is an example of how this mapping would work for one row. 

I've numbered each element of the image matrix with where it should go in the corresponding row in the training matrix. For example, if that were the third image, this would be the third row in the training matrix.
You would have to loop through each image and set the value in the output matrix accordingly. Here's an example for multiple images:

As for how you would do this in code, you could use reshape(), but I've had issues with that due to matrices not being continuous. In my experience I've done something like this:
Mat img_mat = imread(imgname,0); // I used 0 for greyscale
int ii = 0; // Current column in training_mat
for (int i = 0; i<img_mat.rows; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < img_mat.cols; j++) {
        training_mat.at<float>(file_num,ii++) = img_mat.at<uchar>(i,j);
    }
}

Do this for every training image (remembering to increment file_num). After this, you should have your training matrix set up properly to pass into the SVM functions. The rest of the steps should be very similar to examples online.
Note that while doing this, you also have to set up labels for each training image. So for example if you were classifying eyes and non-eyes based on images, you would need to specify which row in the training matrix corresponds to an eye and a non-eye. This is specified as a 1D matrix, where each element in the 1D matrix corresponds to each row in the 2D matrix. Pick values for each class (e.g., -1 for non-eye and 1 for eye) and set them in the labels matrix.
Mat labels(num_files,1,CV_32FC1);

So if the 3rd element in this labels matrix were -1, it means the 3rd row in the training matrix is in the ""non-eye"" class. You can set these values in the loop where you evaluate each image. One thing you could do is to sort the training data into separate directories for each class, and loop through the images in each directory, and set the labels based on the directory.
The next thing to do is set up your SVM parameters. These values will vary based on your project, but basically you would declare a CvSVMParams object and set the values:
CvSVMParams params;
params.svm_type = CvSVM::C_SVC;
params.kernel_type = CvSVM::POLY;
params.gamma = 3;
// ...etc

There are several examples online on how to set these parameters, like in the link you posted in the question.
Next, you create a CvSVM object and train it based on your data!
CvSVM svm;
svm.train(training_mat, labels, Mat(), Mat(), params);

Depending on how much data you have, this could take a long time. After it's done training, however, you can save the trained SVM so you don't have to retrain it every time.
svm.save(""svm_filename""); // saving
svm.load(""svm_filename""); // loading

To test your images using the trained SVM, simply read an image, convert it to a 1D matrix, and pass that in to svm.predict():
svm.predict(img_mat_1d);

It will return a value based on what you set as your labels (e.g., -1 or 1, based on my eye/non-eye example above). Alternatively, if you want to test more than one image at a time, you can create a matrix that has the same format as the training matrix defined earlier and pass that in as the argument. The return value will be different, though.
Good luck!

I have looked at the OpenCV Introduction to Support Vector Machines. But it doesn't help with reading in images, and I am not sure how to incorporate it.

Thanks so much for the explanation. My goals are to classify pixels in an image. These pixel would belong to a curves. I understand forming the training matrix (for instance, 
image A
1,1 1,2 1,3 1,4 1,5
2,1 2,2 2,3 2,4 2,5
3,1 3,2 3,3 3,4 3,5
I would form my training matrix as a [3][2]={ {1,1} {1,2} {1,3} {1,4} {1,5} {2,1} ..{} }
However, I am a little confuse about the labels. From my understanding, I have to specify which row (image) in the training matrix corresponds, which corresponds to a curve or non-curve. But, how can I label a training matrix row (image) if there are some pixels belonging to the curve and some not belonging to a curve. For example, my training matrix is [3][2]={ {1,1} {1,2} {1,3} {1,4} {1,5} {2,1} ..{} }, pixels {1,1} and {1,4} belong to the curve but the rest does not.

What has changed in Zend Framework 2 from Zend Framework 1?
Architecture
ZF1 is based on MVC , ZF2 is based on MOVE. Huge difference. MOVE = Model Operations Views Events , MVC = Models Views Controllers. More here. Zend Framework 2 uses 100% object-oriented code and utilises most of the new features of PHP 5.3, namely namespaces, late static binding, lambda functions and closures. source
Size of installation
The latest ZF1 file is approx 30Mb and ZF2 is approx 2.5Mb (Zipped).
Dependency
ZF1 is core set of libraries and very loosely coupled architecture (with respect to its competitor/player - CakePHP). ZF1 does not require much of 'gems' (as in ruby) but, can do better with plugins. ZF2 requires you to know about composer - phar and soon it may out-match any other framework. New concept : Dependency Injection for Zend fans.
Certification
Certification is available only for ZF1, however, there are rumours about their talks for ZF2 certs though training material is available online.
Conventions
classname in ZF1 was Zend_Db_Table for class in Zend/Db/Table.php whereas in ZF2, it is class My\Auth\Adapter . Enough said.
Community
ZF1 was backed by Zend Technologies (and few other, unnamed). ZF2 has remarkable supporters including Google and Microsoft. Source here
Speed
It took approx 20 times more time to execute ""Hello World!"" in ZF2. I am not judging here. I could be wrong here. DIY.
Which one should I opt for?
MVC is been around since almost a decade and if you are one of them who are feeling sad for a new architecture altogether then hey! IT is 'your chosen' domain, keep up with the trends and update yourself! Start ZF2 from here.

GADTs in general are more flexible in many other ways as well, but for this particular case what happens is that creating a value needs the Ord constraint, which is then carried along with the value, and pattern matching on the constructor pulls it back out. So you don't even need the context on the functions using it, because you know that by virtue of expecting something of type MyType a, you'll get an Ord a constraint with it.

It works, but it also means that as soon as my website hits Google, I'll be wading through spam as spam bots easily pick out my e-mail address.

This is less desirable, because not only will visitors be unable to click on it to send me an e-mail, but smarter spam bots will probably be able to detect the characters that the image contains.

From a general compilers perspective and disregarding VM-specific optimizations:
First, we go through the lexical analysis phase where we tokenize the code.
By way of example, the following tokens may be produced:
[]: ARRAY_INIT
[1]: ARRAY_INIT (NUMBER)
[1, foo]: ARRAY_INIT (NUMBER, IDENTIFIER)
new Array: NEW, IDENTIFIER
new Array(): NEW, IDENTIFIER, CALL
new Array(5): NEW, IDENTIFIER, CALL (NUMBER)
new Array(5,4): NEW, IDENTIFIER, CALL (NUMBER, NUMBER)
new Array(5, foo): NEW, IDENTIFIER, CALL (NUMBER, IDENTIFIER)

Hopefully this should provide you a sufficient visualization so you can understand how much more (or less) processing is required.

Based on the above tokens, we know as a fact ARRAY_INIT will always produce an array.  We therefore simply create an array and populate it.  As far as ambiguity, the lexical analysis stage has already distinguished ARRAY_INIT from an object property accessor (e.g. obj[foo]) or brackets inside strings/regex literals (e.g. ""foo[]bar"" or /[]/)
This is miniscule, but we also have more tokens with new Array.  Furthermore, it's not entirely clear yet that we simply want to create an array.  We see the ""new"" token, but ""new"" what?  We then see the IDENTIFIER token which signifies we want a new ""Array,"" but JavaScript VM's generally do not distinguish an IDENTIFIER token and tokens for ""native global objects.""  Therefore...
We have to look up the scope chain each time we encounter an IDENTIFIER token.  Javascript VMs contain an ""Activation object"" for each execution context which may contain the ""arguments"" object, locally defined variables, etc.  If we cannot find it in the Activation object, we begin looking up the scope chain until we reach the global scope.  If nothing is found, we throw a ReferenceError.
Once we've located the variable declaration, we invoke the constructor.  new Array is an implicit function call, and the rule of thumb is that function calls are slower during execution (hence why static C/C++ compilers allow ""function inlining"" - which JS JIT engines such as SpiderMonkey have to do on-the-fly)
The Array constructor is overloaded.  The Array constructor is implemented as native code so it provides some performance enhancements, but it still needs to check for arguments length and act accordingly.  Moreover, in the event only one argument is supplied, we need to further check the type of the argument.  new Array(""foo"") produces [""foo""] where as new Array(1) produces [undefined]

So to simplify it all: with array literals, the VM knows we want an array; with new Array, the VM needs to use extra CPU cycles to figure out what new Array actually does.

Warning: Flexbox has undergone some major revisions, so this article

  this article is based on, was implemented in Chrome since v4, Firefox
  since v2, and IE10 beta.
Since then, the new flexbox standard debuted and started to debut in
  Chrome 17. Stephan Hay has written a guide on the new flexbox
  implementation. Since then, the spec underwent naming changes which
  started landing in Chrome 21. Chrome 22 has a stable implementation of
  the latest spec.
At this point, implementing either has its risks, so be aware.

Here is the blog about the different flexbox statements.

If you code in C, then obviously go for GTK+
If you code in C++, go for Qt, otherwise you will need Gtkmm (a C++ wrapper over GTK+)
If you code in Python, both GTK+ and Qt have bindings for the language: see PyGtk, PyQt and PySide (the one launched by Nokia themselves).
If you code in Java, Qt is no more a viable option imho as Nokia discontinued Qt Jambi (the Java bindings for Qt).
Also, Qt is more top-notch regarding its scenegraph QGraphicsScene API, its scripting engine built over Javascript Core (the engine powering WebKit), its state machine and animations framework, and the declarative UI.
GTK+ doesn't offer that much although you can use Clutter alongside with it.
If you're specifically looking into DB, XML (GTK+ has a parser for a subset of XML) and threading (GTK+ has GLib) features then Qt will offer all that in QtSql, QtXml and QtConcurrent.
All in all, I would say Qt is a sure choice. But GTK+ is very capable as well.
I'm not sure you will get a crystal clear answer for your question, which explains why some people keep preferring Gnome over KDE or vice-versa. Choose what works best for you.

        case 3: 
            retVal = ""Three"";
            break;
    }

    return retVal;
}

I know that both work, but is one more of a best practice?  I tend to like Option 1 - switch using return best, as it's cleaner and simpler.

Here is a jsFiddle of my specific example using the technique mentioned in @ic3b3rg's comments:
var SFAIC = {};

SFAIC.common = 
{
    masterPages: 
    {
        cs: ""CS_"",
        cp: ""CP_""
    },

    contentPages: 
    {
        cs: ""CSContent_"",
        cp: ""CPContent_""    
    }
};

function getElementPrefix(page) 
{
    return (page in SFAIC.common.masterPages)
        ? SFAIC.common.masterPages[page]
        : (page in SFAIC.common.contentPages)
            ? SFAIC.common.contentPages[page]
            : undefined;
}

To call the function, I would do so in the following ways:
getElementPrefix(SFAIC.common.masterPages.cs);
getElementPrefix(SFAIC.common.masterPages.cp);
getElementPrefix(SFAIC.common.contentPages.cs);
getElementPrefix(SFAIC.common.contentPages.cp);

Problem here is that it always returns undefined.  I'm guessing that it's because it's passing in the actual value of the object literal and not the property.  What would I do to fix this using the technique described in @ic3b3rg's comments?
"
29251025,816620.0,2015-03-25 08:47:03+00:00,29250950,166,"When you do 0[0], the JS interpreter will turn the first 0 into a Number object and then try to access the [0] property of that object which is undefined.
There is no syntax error because the property access syntax 0[0] is allowed by the language grammar in this context.  This structure (using terms in the Javascript grammar) is NumericLiteral[NumericLiteral].
The relevant part of the language grammar from section A.3 of the ES5 ECMAScript spec is this:
Literal ::
    NullLiteral
    BooleanLiteral
    NumericLiteral
    StringLiteral
    RegularExpressionLiteral

PrimaryExpression :
    this
    Identifier
    Literal
    ArrayLiteral
    ObjectLiteral
    ( Expression )

MemberExpression :
    PrimaryExpression
    FunctionExpression
    MemberExpression [ Expression ]
    MemberExpression . IdentifierName
    new MemberExpression Arguments    

So, one can follow the grammer through this progression:
MemberExpression [ Expression ]
PrimaryExpression [ Expression ]
Literal [ Expression ]
NumericLiteral [ Expression ]

And, similarly Expression can also eventually be NumericLiteral so after following the grammar, we see that this is allowed:
NumericLiteral [ NumericLiteral ]

Which means that 0[0] is an allowed part of the grammar and thus no SyntaxError.

Then, at run-time you are allowed to read a property that does not exist (it will just be read as undefined) as long as the source you are reading from either is an object or has an implicit conversion to an object.  And, a numeric literal does indeed have an implicit conversion to an object (a Number object).
This is one of those often unknown features of Javascript.  The types Number, Boolean and String in Javascript are usually stored internally as primitives (not full-blown objects).  These are a compact, immutable storage representation (probably done this way for implementation efficiency).  But, Javascript wants you to be able to treat these primitives like objects with properties and methods.  So, if you try to access a property or method that is not directly supported on the primitive, then Javascript will temporarily coerce the primitive into an appropriate type of object with the value set to the value of the primitive.
When you use an object-like syntax on a primitive such as 0[0], the interpreter recognizes this as a property access on a primitive.  Its response to this is to take the first 0 numeric primitive and coerce it into a full-blown Number object which it can then access the [0] property on.  In this specific case, the [0] property on a Number object is undefined which is why that's the value you get from 0[0].
Here is an article on the auto-conversion of a primitive to an object for purposes of dealing with properties:
The Secret Life of Javascript Primitives

Here are the relevant portions of the ECMAScript 5.1 specification:
9.10 CheckObjectCoercible
Throws TypeError if value is undefined or null, otherwise returns true.

11.2.1 Property Accessors


Let baseReference be the result of evaluating MemberExpression. 
Let baseValue be GetValue(baseReference). 
Let propertyNameReference be the result of evaluating Expression. 
Let propertyNameValue be GetValue(propertyNameReference). 
Call CheckObjectCoercible(baseValue).
Let propertyNameString be ToString(propertyNameValue). 
If the syntactic production that is being evaluated is contained in strict
  mode code, let strict be true, else let strict be false. 
Return a value of type Reference whose base value is baseValue and whose
  referenced name is propertyNameString, and whose strict mode flag is
  strict.


An operative part for this question is step #5 above.
8.7.1 GetValue (V)
This describes how when the value being accessed is a property reference, it calls ToObject(base) to get the object version of any primitive.
9.9 ToObject
This describes how Boolean, Number and String primitives are converted to an object form with the [[PrimitiveValue]] internal property set accordingly.

As an interesting test, if the code was like this:
var x = null;
var a = x[0];

It would still not throw a SyntaxError at parse time as this is technically legal syntax, but it would throw a TypeError at runtime when you run the code because when the above Property Accessors logic is applied to the value of x, it will call CheckObjectCoercible(x) or call ToObject(x) which will both throw a TypeError if x is null or undefined.

1955136,48181.0,2009-12-23 20:29:00+00:00,1953080,65,"I believe in this case it is best to just use a flat file where each word stands in one line. With this you can conveniently use the power of a regular expression search, which is highly optimized and will probably beat any data structure you can devise yourself for this problem.
Solution #1: Using Regex
This is working Ruby code for this problem:
def query(str, data)    
  r = Regexp.new(""^#{str.gsub(""?"", ""."")}$"")
  idx = 0
  begin
    idx = data.index(r, idx)
    if idx
      yield data[idx, str.size]
      idx += str.size + 1
    end
  end while idx
end

start_time = Time.now
query(""?r?te"", File.read(""wordlist.txt"")) do |w|
  puts w
end
puts Time.now - start_time

The file wordlist.txt contains 45425 words (downloadable here). The program's output for query ?r?te is:
brute
crate
Crete
grate
irate
prate
write
wrote
0.013689

So it takes just 37 milliseconds to both read the whole file and to find all matches in it. And it scales very well for all kinds of query patterns, even where a Trie is very slow:
query ????????????????e
counterproductive
indistinguishable
microarchitecture
microprogrammable
0.018681

query ?h?a?r?c?l?
theatricals
0.013608

This looks fast enough for me.
Solution #2: Regex with Prepared Data
If you want to go even faster, you can split the wordlist into strings that contain words of equal lengths and just search the correct one based on your query length. Replace the last 5 lines with this code:
def query_split(str, data)
  query(str, data[str.length]) do |w|
    yield w
  end
end

# prepare data    
data = Hash.new("""")
File.read(""wordlist.txt"").each_line do |w|
  data[w.length-1] += w
end

# use prepared data for query
start_time = Time.now
query_split(""?r?te"", data) do |w|
  puts w
end
puts Time.now - start_time

Building the data structure takes now about 0.4 second, but all queries are about 10 times faster (depending on the number of words with that length):

?r?te 0.001112 sec
?h?a?r?c?l? 0.000852 sec
????????????????e 0.000169 sec

Solution #3: One Big Hashtable (Updated Requirements)
Since you have changed your requirements, you can easily expand on your idea to use just one big hashtable that contains all precalculated results. But instead of working around collisions yourself you could rely on the performance of a properly implemented hashtable.
Here I create one big hashtable, where each possible query maps to a list of its results:
def create_big_hash(data)
  h = Hash.new do |h,k|
    h[k] = Array.new
  end    
  data.each_line do |l|
    w = l.strip
    # add all words with one ?
    w.length.times do |i|
      q = String.new(w)
      q[i] = ""?""
      h[q].push w
    end
    # add all words with two ??
    (w.length-1).times do |i|
      q = String.new(w)      
      q[i, 2] = ""??""
      h[q].push w
    end
  end
  h
end

# prepare data    
t = Time.new
h = create_big_hash(File.read(""wordlist.txt""))
puts ""#{Time.new - t} sec preparing data\n#{h.size} entries in big hash""

# use prepared data for query
t = Time.new
h[""?ood""].each do |w|
  puts w
end
puts (Time.new - t)

Output is
4.960255 sec preparing data
616745 entries in big hash
food
good
hood
mood
wood
2.0e-05

The query performance is O(1), it is just a lookup in the hashtable. The time 2.0e-05 is probably below the timer's precision. When running it 1000 times, I get an average of 1.958e-6 seconds per query. To get it faster, I would switch to C++ and use the Google Sparse Hash which is extremely memory efficient, and fast.
Solution #4: Get Really Serious
All above solutions work and should be good enough for many use cases. If you really want to get serious and have lots of spare time on your hands, read some good papers:

Tries for Approximate String Matching - If well implemented, tries can have very compact memory requirements (50% less space than the dictionary itself), and are very fast.
Agrep - A Fast Approximate Pattern-Matching Tool - Agrep is based on a new efficient and flexible algorithm for approximate string matching.
Google Scholar search for approximate string matching - More than enough to read on this topic.

For example, if I have th??e, I might get back these, those, theme, there.etc.
I was wondering if anyone can suggest some data structures or algorithm I should use.
Thanks!
EDIT: A Trie is too space-inefficient and would make it too slow. Any other ideas modifications?
UPDATE: There will be up to TWO question marks and when two question marks do occur, they will occur in sequence.
Currently I am using 3 hash tables for when it is an exact match, 1 question mark, and 2 question marks.
Given a dictionary I hash all the possible words. For example, if I have the word WORD. I hash WORD, ?ORD, W?RD, WO?D, WOR?, ??RD, W??D, WO??. into the dictionary. Then I use a link list to link the collisions together. So say hash(W?RD) = hash(STR?NG) = 17. hashtab(17) will point to WORD and WORD points to STRING because it is a linked list.
The timing on average lookup of one word is about 2e-6s. I am looking to do better, preferably on the order of 1e-9.
EDIT: I haven't looked at this problem again but it took 0.5 seconds for 3m entries insertions and it took 4 seconds for 3m entries lookup.
Thanks!

Be sure to do this after the view is dequeued or created (and not only in the if anView == nil part).  Otherwise, annotations that use a dequeued view will show the image of the annotation that used the view previously.
With the basic MKPointAnnotation, one crude way to tell annotations apart is by their title but that's not very flexible.
A better approach is to use a custom annotation class that implements the MKAnnotation protocol (an easy way to do that is to subclass MKPointAnnotation) and add whatever properties are needed to help implement the custom logic.
In the custom class, add a property, say imageName, which you can use to customize the image based on the annotation.
This example subclasses MKPointAnnotation:
class CustomPointAnnotation: MKPointAnnotation {
    var imageName: String!
}

Create annotations of type CustomPointAnnotation and set their imageName:
var info1 = CustomPointAnnotation()
info1.coordinate = CLLocationCoordinate2DMake(42, -84)
info1.title = ""Info1""
info1.subtitle = ""Subtitle""
info1.imageName = ""1.png""

var info2 = CustomPointAnnotation()
info2.coordinate = CLLocationCoordinate2DMake(32, -95)
info2.title = ""Info2""
info2.subtitle = ""Subtitle""
info2.imageName = ""2.png""

In viewForAnnotation, use the imageName property to set the view's image:
func mapView(mapView: MKMapView!, viewForAnnotation annotation: MKAnnotation!) -> MKAnnotationView! {
    if !(annotation is CustomPointAnnotation) {
        return nil

In words: Find out the length of the file you want to end up with (length of file minus length of length of its last line, using bc) and, set that position to be the end of the file (by dding one byte of  /dev/null onto it). 
This is fast because tail starts reading from the end, and dd will overwrite the file in place rather than copy (and parse) every line of the file, which is what the other solutions do.

I haven't really tried any others to offer any comparison, but I've been happy with this implementation.
I'm not affiliated with the group that offers the software, but I am a fan.
Four things I like about this system:

It has a defect checkers for nullness (@Nullable), but also has ones for immutability and interning (and others).  I use the first one (nullness) and I'm trying to get into using the second one (immutability/IGJ).  I'm trying out the third one, but I'm not certain about using it long term yet.  I'm not convinced of the general usefulness of the other checkers yet, but its nice to know that the framework itself is a system for implementing a variety of additional annotations and checkers.
The default setting for nullness checking works well: Non-null except locals (NNEL).  Basically this means that by default the checker treats everyhing (instance variables, method parameters, generic types, etc) except local variables as if they have a @NonNull type by default.  Per the documentation:

The NNEL default leads to the smallest number of explicit annotations in your code.

You can set a different default for a class or for a method if NNEL doesn't work for you.
This framework allows you to use with without creating a dependency on the framework by enclosing your annotations in a comment: e.g. /*@Nullable*/.  This is nice because you can annotate and check a library or shared code, but still be able to use that library/shared coded in another project that doesn't use the framework.  This is a nice feature.  I've grown accustom to using it, even though I tend to enable the Checker Framework on all my projects now. 
The framework has a way to annotate APIs you use that aren't already annotated for nullness by using stub files.

I.E. it would figure out the field names and values and send them out to a String.
Getting the field names is fairly simple, here is what a co-worker came up with:
public static List initFieldArray(String className) throws ClassNotFoundException {

    Class c = Class.forName(className);
    Field field[] = c.getFields();
    List<String> classFields = new ArrayList(field.length);

Using a factory I could reduce the performance overhead by storing the fields once, the first time the toString() is called. However finding the values could be a lot more expensive.
Due to the performance of reflection this may be more hypothetical then practical. But I am interested in the idea of reflection and how I can use it to improve my everyday programming.

What can I use for ""???file-exists???""?
Once I find this, I'll add ""mark-read-only"" to the appropriate hook (which I think is the find-file-hook).
BACKGROUND
We use lzz as a code generator to simplify our C/C++ development process.  Briefly, lzz takes a single input file (which looks very like C/C++) and generates header and source files as appropriate.
By default, lzz includes #line directives so that the debugger points to the original source and not the generated source, however, to reduce compilation dependencies we normally disable these directives in header files.  The result is that when debugging templates or inline functions, the debugger normally points to the generated header file and not the original source file.
This is not a big deal, however, recently I've found that when debugging I'll make a quick modification to the displayed file and then I'll rebuild.  Of course this normally means that the change I made disappears because the file I edited is generated and so the changes are ""blown away"" during the library rebuild.

538238,12597.0,2009-02-11 18:55:20+00:00,538060,1858,"The point of Dispose is to free unmanaged resources. It needs to be done at some point, otherwise they will never be cleaned up. The garbage collector doesn't know how to call DeleteHandle() on a variable of type IntPtr, it doesn't know whether or not it needs to call DeleteHandle().

Note: What is an unmanaged resource? If you found it in the Microsoft .NET Framework: it's managed. If you went poking around MSDN yourself, it's unmanaged. Anything you've used P/Invoke calls to get outside of the nice comfy world of everything available to you in the .NET Framwork is unmanaged â and you're now responsible for cleaning it up.

The object that you've created needs to expose some method, that the outside world can call, in order to clean up unmanaged resources. The method can be named whatever you like: 
public void Cleanup()

public void Shutdown()

But instead there is a standardized name for this method:
public void Dispose()

There was even an interface created, IDisposable, that has just that one method:
public interface IDisposable
{
   void Dispose()
}

So you make your object expose the IDisposable interface, and that way you promise that you've written that single method to clean up your unmanaged resources:
public void Dispose()
{
   Win32.DestroyHandle(this.CursorFileBitmapIconServiceHandle);
}

And you're done. Except you can do better.

What if your object has allocated a 250MB System.Drawing.Bitmap (i.e. the .NET managed Bitmap class) as some sort of frame buffer? Sure, this is a managed .NET object, and the garbage collector will free it. But do you really want to leave 250MB of memory just sitting there â waiting for the garbage collector to eventually come along and free it? What if there's an open database connection? Surely we don't want that connection sitting open, waiting for the GC to finalize the object.
If the user has called Dispose() (meaning they no longer plan to use the object) why not get rid of those wasteful bitmaps and database connections?
So now we will:

get rid of unmanaged resources (because we have to), and 
get rid of managed resources (because we want to be helpful)

So let's update our Dispose() method to get rid of those managed objects:
public void Dispose()
{
   //Free unmanaged resources
   Win32.DestroyHandle(this.CursorFileBitmapIconServiceHandle);

   //Free managed resources too
   if (this.databaseConnection != null)
   {
      this.databaseConnection.Dispose();
      this.databaseConnection = null;
   }
   if (this.frameBufferImage != null)
   {
      this.frameBufferImage.Dispose();
      this.frameBufferImage = null;
   }
}

And all is good, except you can do better!

What if the person forgot to call Dispose() on your object? Then they would leak some unmanaged resources! 

Note: They won't leak managed resources, because eventually the garbage collector is going to run, on a background thread, and free the memory associated with any unused objects. This will include your object, and any managed objects you use (e.g. the Bitmap and the DbConnection).

If the person forgot to call Dispose(), we can still save their bacon! We still have a way to call it for them: when the garbage collector finally gets around to freeing (i.e. finalizing) our object.

Note: The garbage collector will eventually free all managed objects.
  When it does, it calls the Finalize
  method on the object. The GC doesn't know, or
  care, about your Dispose method.
  That was just a name we chose for 
  a method we call when we want to get
  rid of unmanaged stuff.

The destruction of our object by the Garbage collector is the perfect time to free those pesky unmanaged resources. We do this by overriding the Finalize() method. 

Note: In C#, you don't explicitly override the Finalize() method. 
  You write a method that looks like a C++ destructor, and the 
  compiler takes that to be your implementation of the Finalize() method:

~MyObject()
{
    //we're being finalized (i.e. destroyed), call Dispose in case the user forgot to
    Dispose(); //<--Warning: subtle bug! Keep reading!
}

But there's a bug in that code. You see, the garbage collector runs on a background thread; you don't know the order in which two objects are destroyed. It is entirely possible that in your Dispose() code, the managed object you're trying to get rid of (because you wanted to be helpful) is no longer there:
public void Dispose()
{
   //Free unmanaged resources
   Win32.DestroyHandle(this.gdiCursorBitmapStreamFileHandle);

   //Free managed resources too
   if (this.databaseConnection != null)
   {
      this.databaseConnection.Dispose(); //<-- crash, GC already destroyed it
      this.databaseConnection = null;
   }
   if (this.frameBufferImage != null)
   {
      this.frameBufferImage.Dispose(); //<-- crash, GC already destroyed it
      this.frameBufferImage = null;
   }
}

So what you need is a way for Finalize() to tell Dispose() that it should not touch any managed resources (because they might not be there anymore), while still freeing unmanaged resources.
The standard pattern to do this is to have Finalize() and Dispose() both call a third(!) method; where you pass a Boolean saying if you're calling it from Dispose() (as opposed to Finalize()), meaning it's safe to free managed resources.
This internal method could be given some arbitrary name like ""CoreDispose"", or ""MyInternalDispose"", but is tradition to call it Dispose(Boolean):
protected void Dispose(Boolean disposing)

But a more helpful parameter name might be:
protected void Dispose(Boolean itIsSafeToAlsoFreeManagedObjects)
{
   //Free unmanaged resources
   Win32.DestroyHandle(this.CursorFileBitmapIconServiceHandle);

   //Free managed resources too, but only if I'm being called from Dispose
   //(If I'm being called from Finalize then the objects might not exist
   //anymore
   if (itIsSafeToAlsoFreeManagedObjects)  
   {    
      if (this.databaseConnection != null)
      {
         this.databaseConnection.Dispose();
         this.databaseConnection = null;
      }
      if (this.frameBufferImage != null)
      {
         this.frameBufferImage.Dispose();
         this.frameBufferImage = null;
      }
   }
}

And you change your implementation of the IDisposable.Dispose() method to:
public void Dispose()
{
   Dispose(true); //I am calling you from Dispose, it's safe
}

and your finalizer to:
~MyObject()
{
   Dispose(false); //I am *not* calling you from Dispose, it's *not* safe
}


Note: If your object descends from an object that implements Dispose, then don't forget to call their base Dispose method when you override Dispose:

public Dispose()
{
    try
    {
        Dispose(true); //true: safe to free managed resources
    }
    finally
    {
        base.Dispose();
    }
}

And all is good, except you can do better!

If the user calls Dispose() on your object, then everything has been cleaned up. Later on, when the garbage collector comes along and calls Finalize, it will then call Dispose again. 
Not only is this wasteful, but if your object has junk references to objects you already disposed of from the last call to Dispose(), you'll try to dispose them again! 
You'll notice in my code I was careful to remove references to objects that I've disposed, so I don't try to call Dispose on a junk object reference. But that didn't stop a subtle bug from creeping in.
When the user calls Dispose(): the handle CursorFileBitmapIconServiceHandle is destroyed. Later when the garbage collector runs, it will try to destroy the same handle again.
protected void Dispose(Boolean iAmBeingCalledFromDisposeAndNotFinalize)
{
   //Free unmanaged resources
   Win32.DestroyHandle(this.CursorFileBitmapIconServiceHandle); //<--double destroy 
   ...
}

The way you fix this is tell the garbage collector that it doesn't need to bother finalizing the object â its resources have already been cleaned up, and no more work is needed. You do this by calling GC.SuppressFinalize() in the Dispose() method:
public void Dispose()
{
   Dispose(true); //I am calling you from Dispose, it's safe
   GC.SuppressFinalize(this); //Hey, GC: don't bother calling finalize later
}

Now that the user has called Dispose(), we have:

freed unmanaged resources
freed managed resources

There's no point in the GC running the finalizer â everything's taken care of.
Couldn't I use Finalize to cleanup unmanaged resources?
The documentation for Object.Finalize says:

The Finalize method is used to perform cleanup operations on unmanaged resources held by the current object before the object is destroyed.

But the MSDN documentation also says, for IDisposable.Dispose:

Performs application-defined tasks associated with freeing, releasing, or resetting unmanaged resources.

So which is it? Which one is the place for me to cleanup unmanaged resources? The answer is: 

It's your choice! But choose Dispose.

You certainly could place your unmanaged cleanup in the finalizer:
~MyObject()
{
   //Free unmanaged resources
   Win32.DestroyHandle(this.CursorFileBitmapIconServiceHandle);

   //A C# destructor automatically calls the destructor of its base class.
}

The problem with that is you have no idea when the garbage collector will get around to finalizing your object. Your un-managed, un-needed, un-used native resources will stick around until the garbage collector eventually runs. Then it will call your finalizer method; cleaning up unmanaged resources. The documentation of Object.Finalize points this out:

The exact time when the finalizer executes is undefined. To ensure deterministic release of resources for instances of your class, implement a Close method or provide a IDisposable.Dispose implementation.

This is the virtue of using Dispose to cleanup unmanaged resources; you get to know, and control, when unmanaged resource are cleaned up. Their destruction is ""deterministic"".

To answer your original question: Why not release memory now, rather than for when the GC decides to do it? I have a facial recognition software that needs to get rid of 530 MB of internal images now, since they're no longer needed. When we don't: the machine grinds to a swapping halt.

In 35 pages he explains the problems of using binary objects, and invents COM before your eyes. Once you realize the why of COM, the remaining 300 pages are obvious, and just detail Microsoft's implementation.
I think every programmer who has ever dealt with objects or COM should, at the very least, read the first chapter. It is the best explanation of anything ever.

To me, ""unmanaged"" means things like database connections, sockets, window handles, etc.  But, I've seen code where the Dispose method is implemented to free managed resources, which seems redundant to me, since the garbage collector should take care of that for you.
For example:
public class MyCollection : IDisposable
{
    private List<String> _theList = new List<String>();
    private Dictionary<String, Point> _theDict = new Dictionary<String, Point>();

    // Die, clear it up! (free unmanaged resources)
    public void Dispose()

        _theList.clear();
        _theDict.clear();
        _theList = null;
        _theDict = null;
    }

My question is, does this make the garbage collector free memory used by MyCollection any faster than it normally would?
edit:  So far people have posted some good examples of using IDisposable to clean up unmanaged resources such as database connections and bitmaps.  But suppose that _theList in the above code contained a million strings, and you wanted to free that memory now, rather than waiting for the garbage collector.  Would the above code accomplish that?

if (x % 2) { /* x is odd */ }

A few people have criticized my answer above stating that using x & 1 is ""faster"" or ""more efficient"". I do not believe this to be the case. 
Out of curiosity, I created two trivial test case programs:
/* modulo.c */
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
    int x;
    for (x = 0; x < 10; x++)

        if (x & 1)

    return 0;
}

I then compiled these with gcc 4.1.3 on one of my machines 5 different times:

With no optimization flags.
With -O
With -Os
With -O2
With -O3

I examined the assembly output of each compile (using gcc -S) and found that in each case, the output for and.c and modulo.c were identical (they both used the andl $1, %eax instruction). I doubt this is a ""new"" feature, and I suspect it dates back to ancient versions. I also doubt any modern (made in the past 20 years) non-arcane compiler, commercial or open source, lacks such optimization. I would test on other compilers, but I don't have any available at the moment.
If anyone else would care to test other compilers and/or platform targets, and gets a different result, I'd be very interested to know.
Finally, the modulo version is guaranteed by the standard to work whether the integer is positive, negative or zero, regardless of the implementation's representation of signed integers. The bitwise-and version is not. Yes, I realise two's complement is somewhat ubiquitous, so this is not really an issue.

keys := make([]int, len(mymap))

i := 0
for k := range mymap {
    keys[i] = k
    i++
}

In most situations it probably won't make much of a difference, but it's not much more work, and in my tests (using a map with 1,000,000 random int64 keys and then generating the array of keys ten times with each method), it was about 20% faster to assign members of the array directly than to use append.
Although setting the capacity reduces eliminates reallocations, append still has to do extra work to check if you've reached capacity on each append.

For example, the fact that ""...(Almost) All operations on byte, short will promote these primitives to int"". However, the obvious next question would be: WHY are these types promoted to int?
So to go one level deeper: The answer may simply be related to the Java Virtual Machine Instruction Set. As summarized in the Table in the Java Virtual Machine Specification, all integral arithmetic operations, like adding, dividing and others, are only available for the type int and the type long, and not for the smaller types. 
(An aside: The smaller types (byte and short) are basically only intended for arrays. An array like new byte[1000] will take 1000 bytes, and an array like new int[1000] will take 4000 bytes) 
Now, of course, one could say that ""...the obvious next question would be: WHY are these instructions only offered for int (and long)?"". 
One reason is mentioned in the JVM Spec mentioned above:

If each typed instruction supported all of the Java Virtual Machine's run-time data types, there would be more instructions than could be represented in a byte

Additionally, the Java Virtual Machine can be considered as an abstraction of a real processor. And introducing dedicated Arithmetic Logic Unit for smaller types would not be worth the effort: It would need additional transistors, but it still could only execute one addition in one clock cycle. The dominant architecture when the JVM was designed was 32bits, just right for a 32bit int. (The operations that involve a 64bit long value are implemented as a special case).  
(Note: The last paragraph is a bit oversimplified, considering possible vectorization etc., but should give the basic idea without diving too deep into processor design topics)

EDIT: A short addendum, focussing on the example from the question, but in an more general sense: One could also ask whether it would not be beneficial to store fields using the smaller types. For example, one might think that memory could be saved by storing Calendar.DAY_OF_WEEK as a byte. But here, the Java Class File Format comes into play: All the Fields in a Class File occupy at least one ""slot"", which has the size of one int (32 bits). (The ""wide"" fields, double and long, occupy two slots). So explicitly declaring a field as short or byte would not save any memory either.

Going forward, if you look on the Info tab for your Application Target, you should use the ""Bundle versions string, short"" as your Version (e.g., 3.4.0) and ""Bundle version"" as your Build (e.g., 500 or 1A500). If you don't see them both, you can add them. Those will map to the proper Version and Build textboxes on the Summary tab; they are the same values.
When viewing the Info tab, if you right-click and select Show Raw Keys/Values, you'll see the actual names are CFBundleShortVersionString (Version) and CFBundleVersion (Build).
The Version is usually used how you appear to have been using it with Xcode 3. I'm not sure on what level you're asking about the Version/Build difference, so I'll answer it philosophically.
There are all sorts of schemes, but a popular one is:
{MajorVersion}.{MinorVersion}.{Revision}

Major version - Major changes, redesigns, and functionality
changes
Minor version - Minor improvements, additions to functionality
Revision - A patch number for bug-fixes

Then the Build is used separately to indicate the total number of builds for a release or for the entire product lifetime.
Many developers start the Build number at 0, and every time they build they increase the number by one, increasing forever. In my projects, I have a script that automatically increases the build number every time I build. See instructions for that below.

Release 1.0.0 might be build 542. It took 542 builds to get to a
1.0.0 release.
Release 1.0.1 might be build 578.
Release 1.1.0 might be build 694.
Release 2.0.0 might be build 949.

Other developers, including Apple, have a Build number comprised of a major version + minor version + number of builds for the release. These are the actual software version numbers, as opposed to the values used for marketing.
If you go to Xcode menu > About Xcode, you'll see the Version and Build numbers. If you hit the More Info... button you'll see a bunch of different versions. Since the More Info... button was removed in Xcode 5, this information is also available from the Software > Developer section of the System Information app, available by opening Apple menu > About This Mac > System Report....
For example, Xcode 4.2 (4C139). Marketing version 4.2 is Build major version 4, Build minor version C, and Build number 139. The next release (presumably 4.3) will likely be Build release 4D, and the Build number will start over at 0 and increment from there.
The iPhone Simulator Version/Build numbers are the same way, as are iPhones, Macs, etc.

3.2: (7W367a)
4.0: (8A400)
4.1: (8B117)
4.2: (8C134)
4.3: (8H7)

Update: By request, here are the steps to create a script that runs each time you build your app in Xcode to read the Build number, increment it, and write it back to the app's {App}-Info.plist file. There are optional, additional steps if you want to write your version/build numbers to your Settings.bundle/Root*.plist file(s).
This is extended from the how-to article here.
In Xcode 4.2 - 5.0:

Load your Xcode project.
In the left hand pane, click on your project at the very top of the hierarchy. This will load the project settings editor.
On the left-hand side of the center window pane, click on your app under the TARGETS heading. You will need to configure this setup for each project target.
Select the Build Phases tab.


In Xcode 4, at the bottom right, click the Add Build Phase button and select Add Run Script.
In Xcode 5, select Editor menu > Add Build Phase > Add Run Script Build Phase.

Drag-and-drop the new Run Script phase to move it to just before the Copy Bundle Resources phase (when the app-info.plist file will be bundled with your app).
In the new Run Script phase, set Shell: /bin/bash.
Copy and paste the following into the script area for integer build numbers:
buildNumber=$(/usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -c ""Print CFBundleVersion"" ""$INFOPLIST_FILE"")
buildNumber=$(($buildNumber + 1))
/usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -c ""Set :CFBundleVersion $buildNumber"" ""$INFOPLIST_FILE""

As @Bdebeez pointed out, the Apple Generic Versioning Tool (agvtool) is also available. If you prefer to use it instead, then there are a couple things to change first:

Select the Build Settings tab.
Under the Versioning section, set the Current Project Version to the initial build number you want to use, e.g., 1.
Back on the Build Phases tab, drag-and-drop your Run Script phase after the Copy Bundle Resources phase to avoid a race condition when trying to both build and update the source file that includes your build number. 

Note that with the agvtool method you may still periodically get failed/canceled builds with no errors. For this reason, I don't recommend using agvtool with this script.
Nevertheless, in your Run Script phase, you can use the following script:
""${DEVELOPER_BIN_DIR}/agvtool"" next-version -all

The next-version argument increments the build number (bump is also an alias for the same thing), and -all updates Info.plist with the new build number.
And if you have a Settings bundle where you show the Version and Build, you can add the following to the end of the script to update the version and build. Note: Change the PreferenceSpecifiers values to match your settings. PreferenceSpecifiers:2 means look at the item at index 2 under the PreferenceSpecifiers array in your plist file, so for a 0-based index, that's the 3rd preference setting in the array.
productVersion=$(/usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -c ""Print CFBundleShortVersionString"" ""$INFOPLIST_FILE"")
/usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -c ""Set PreferenceSpecifiers:2:DefaultValue $buildNumber"" Settings.bundle/Root.plist
/usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -c ""Set PreferenceSpecifiers:1:DefaultValue $productVersion"" Settings.bundle/Root.plist

If you're using agvtool instead of reading the Info.plist directly, you can add the following to your script instead:
buildNumber=$(""${DEVELOPER_BIN_DIR}/agvtool"" what-version -terse)
productVersion=$(""${DEVELOPER_BIN_DIR}/agvtool"" what-marketing-version -terse1)
/usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -c ""Set PreferenceSpecifiers:2:DefaultValue $buildNumber"" Settings.bundle/Root.plist
/usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -c ""Set PreferenceSpecifiers:1:DefaultValue $productVersion"" Settings.bundle/Root.plist

And if you have a universal app for iPad & iPhone, then you can also set the settings for the iPhone file:
/usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -c ""Set PreferenceSpecifiers:2:DefaultValue $buildNumber"" Settings.bundle/Root~iphone.plist    
/usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -c ""Set PreferenceSpecifiers:1:DefaultValue $productVersion"" Settings.bundle/Root~iphone.plist

User space is basically a form of sand-boxing -- it restricts user programs so they can't mess with memory (and other resources) owned by other programs or by the OS kernel. This limits (but usually doesn't entirely eliminate) their ability to do bad things like crashing the machine.
The kernel is the core of the operating system. It normally has full access to all memory and machine hardware (and everything else on the machine). To keep the machine as stable as possible, you normally want only the most trusted, well-tested code to run in kernel mode/kernel space.
The stack is just another part of memory, so naturally it's segregated right along with the rest of memory.

As mentioned in a below post, AsyncTask is a good starting point to look into. I encourage readers to look into the framework provisions first before even beginning to think about doing their own threading.
There are several problems in the code sample you posted I will address in order:
1) Thread.stop() has been deprecated for quite some time now, as it can leave dependent variables in inconsistent states in some circumstances. See this Sun answer page for more details (Edit: that link is now dead, see this page for why not to use Thread.stop()). A preferred method of stopping and starting a thread is as follows (assuming your thread will run somewhat indefinitely):
private volatile Thread runner;

public synchronized void startThread(){
  if(runner == null){
    runner = new Thread(this);
    runner.start();
  }
}

public synchronized void stopThread(){
  if(runner != null){
    Thread moribund = runner;
    runner = null;
    moribund.interrupt();
  }
}

public void run(){
  while(Thread.currentThread() == runner){
    //do stuff which can be interrupted if necessary
  }
}

This is just one example of how to stop a thread, but the takeaway is that you are responsible for exiting a thread just as you would any other method. Maintain a method of cross thread communcation (in this case a volatile variable, could also be through a mutex, etc) and within your thread logic, use that method of communication to check if you should early exit, cleanup, etc.
2) Your measurements list is accessed by multiple threads (the event thread and your user thread) at the same time without any synchronization. It looks like you don't have to roll your own synchronization, you can use a BlockingQueue.
3) You are creating a new Socket every iteration of your sending Thread. This is a rather heavyweight operation, and only really make sense if you expect measurements to be extremely infrequent (say one an hour or less). Either you want a persistent socket that is not recreated every loop of the thread, or you want a one shot runnable you can 'fire and forget' which creates a socket, sends all relevant data, and finishes. (A quick note about using a persistent Socket, socket methods which block, such as reading, cannot be interrupted by Thread.interrupt(), and so when you want to stop the thread, you must close the socket as well as calling interrupt)
4) There is little point in throwing your own exceptions from within a Thread unless you expect to catch it somewhere else. A better solution is to log the error and if it is irrecoverable, stop the thread. A thread can stop itself with code like (in the same context as above):
public void run(){
    while(Thread.currentThread() == runner){
      //do stuff which can be interrupted if necessary

      if(/*fatal error*/){
        stopThread();
        return; //optional in this case since the loop will exit anyways
      }
    }
  }

Finally, if you want to be sure a thread exits with the rest of your application, no matter what, a good technique is to call Thread.setDaemon(true) after creation and before you start the thread. This flags the thread as a daemon thread, meaning the VM will ensure that it is automatically destroyed if there are no non-daemon threads running (such as if your app quits).
Obeying best practices with regards to Threads should ensure that your app doesn't hang or slow down the phone, though they can be quite complex :)

4834508,501557.0,2011-01-29 01:27:52+00:00,4834490,53,"There is a beautiful structure called an extendible array that has worst-case O(1) insertion and O(n) memory overhead (that is, it's asymptotically comparable to a dynamic array, but has O(1) worst-case insertion).  The trick is to take the approach that the vector uses - doubling and copying - but to make the copying lazy.  For example, suppose you have an array of four elements like this one:
[1] [2] [3] [4]

If you want to add a new number, say 5, you begin by allocating an array that's twice as large:
[1] [2] [3] [4]
[ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ]

Next, you insert 5 into the new array:
[1] [2] [3] [4]
[ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [5] [ ] [ ] [ ]

Finally, pull down the 4 from the old array into the new:
[1] [2] [3] [ ]
[ ] [ ] [ ] [4] [5] [ ] [ ] [ ]

From now on, any time you do an insert, add the element to the new array and pull down one more element from the old array.  For example, after adding 6, we'd get
[1] [2] [ ] [ ]
[ ] [ ] [3] [4] [5] [6] [ ] [ ]

After inserting two more values, we end up here:
[ ] [ ] [ ] [ ]
[1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8]

If we now need to add one more element, we discard the now-empty old array and allocate an array twice as large as the current array (capable of holding 16 elements):
[1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8]
[ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ]

And repeat this process.  Discounting the cost of a memory allocation (which is usually sublinear in the size of the array), you do at most O(1) work per insertion.
Lookups are still O(1), since you just decide which of the two arrays to look in, while insertions in the middle are O(n) because of the shuffling.
If you're curious, I have a Java implementation of this structure on my personal site.  I don't know how useful you'll find it, but you're more than welcome to try it out.
Hope this helps!
EDIT: If you want to invest a bit of time reading over a research paper and trying to implement a fairly complex data structure, you can get the same result (worst-case O(1) append) in O(√n) space overhead (which is provably optimal, by the way) using the ideas in this paper.  I never got around to actually implementing this, but it's certainly well-worth the read if memory is a super-scarce resource.  Interestingly, it uses this above construction as a subroutine!
",4834490,105570.0,2011-01-29 01:21:51+00:00,,25,A data structure supporting O(1) random access and worst-case O(1) append?,"I realize a resizable indexed collection that uses an array to store its elements (like List<T> in .NET or ArrayList in Java) has amortized O(1) insertion time at the end of the collection. But then there's always that one pesky insertion at critical junctures where the collection has just reached its capacity and the next insertion requires a full copy of all elements in the internal array to a new one (presumably twice as large).
A common mistake (in my opinion) is to go with a linked list to ""fix"" this problem; but I believe the overhead of allocating a node for every element can be quite wasteful, and in fact would dwarf the benefit of a guaranteed O(1) insertion in that rare case that the array insertion is costlyâwhen, in fact, every other array insertion is significantly cheaper (and faster).
What I was thinking might make sense is a hybrid approach consisting of a linked list of arrays, where every time the current ""head"" array reaches its capacity, a new array twice as large is added to the linked list. Then no copy would be necessary since the linked list would still have the original array. Essentially this seems analogous (to me) to the List<T> or ArrayList approach, except that wherever you previously would've incurred the cost of copying all the elements of the internal array, here you only incur the cost of allocating a new array plus a single node insertion.
Of course, this would complicate other features if they were desired (e.g., inserting/removing into/from the middle of the collection); but as I've expressed in the title, I'm really just looking for an add-only (and iterate) collection.
Are there any data structures out there ideally suited to this purpose? Or, can you think of one yourself?

37801371,957768.0,2016-06-14 00:58:40+00:00,37801370,56,"Since the beginning, Swift has provided some facilities for making ObjC and C more Swifty, adding more with each version. Now, in Swift 3, the new ""import as member"" feature lets frameworks with certain styles of C API -- where you have a data type that works sort of like a class, and a bunch of global functions to work with it -- act more like Swift-native APIs. The data types import as Swift classes, their related global functions import as methods and properties on those classes, and some related things like sets of constants can become subtypes where appropriate.
In Xcode 8 / Swift 3 beta, Apple has applied this feature (along with a few others) to make the Dispatch framework much more Swifty. (And Core Graphics, too.) If you've been following the Swift open-source efforts, this isn't news, but now is the first time it's part of Xcode.
Your first step on moving any project to Swift 3 should be to open it in Xcode 8 and choose Edit > Convert > To Current Swift Syntax... in the menu. This will apply (with your review and approval) all of the changes at once needed for all the renamed APIs and other changes. (Often, a line of code is affected by more than one of these changes at once, so responding to error fix-its individually might not handle everything right.)
The result is that the common pattern for bouncing work to the background and back now looks like this:
// Move to a background thread to do some long running work
DispatchQueue.global(attributes: .qosUserInitiated).async {
    let image = self.loadOrGenerateAnImage()
    // Bounce back to the main thread to update the UI
    DispatchQueue.main.async {
        self.imageView.image = image
    }
}

Note we're using qosUserInitiated instead of one of the old DISPATCH_QUEUE_PRIORITY constants. Quality of Service (QoS) specifiers were introduced in OS X 10.10 / iOS 8.0, providing a clearer way for the system to prioritize work and deprecating the old priority specifiers. See Apple's docs on background work and energy efficiency for details.
By the way, if you're keeping your own queues to organize work, the way to get one now looks like this (notice that DispatchQueueAttributes is an OptionSet, so you use collection-style literals to combine options):
class Foo { 
    let myQueue = DispatchQueue(label: ""com.example.my-serial-queue"",
                           attributes: [.serial, .qosUtility])
    func doStuff() {
        queue.async {
            print(""Hello World"")
        }
    }
}

Using dispatch_after to do work later? That's a method on queues, too, and it takes a DispatchTime, which has operators for various numeric types so you can just add whole or fractional seconds:
DispatchQueue.main.asyncAfter(deadline: .now() + 0.5) { // in half a second...
    print(""Are we there yet?"")
}

You can find your way around the new Dispatch API by opening its interface in Xcode 8 -- use Open Quickly to find the Dispatch module, or put a symbol (like DispatchQueue) in your Swift project/playground and command-click it, then brouse around the module from there. (You can find the Swift Dispatch API in Apple's spiffy new API Reference website and in-Xcode doc viewer, but it looks like the doc content from the C version hasn't moved into it just yet.)
See the Migration Guide for more tips.

Assert liberally. You can never have too many assertions.
Assertions don't replace exceptions. Exceptions cover the things your code demands; assertions cover the things it assumes.
A well-written assertion can tell you not just what happened and where (like an exception), but why.
An exception message can often be cryptic, requiring you to work backwards through the code to recreate the context that caused the error. An assertion can preserve the program's state at the time the error occurred.
Assertions double as documentation, telling other developers what implied assumptions your code depends on.
The dialog that appears when an assertion fails lets you attach a debugger to the process, so you can poke around the stack as if you had put a breakpoint there.

PS: If you liked Code Complete, I recommend following it up with this book. I bought it to learn about using WinDBG and dump files, but the first half is packed with tips to help avoid bugs in the first place.

15281447,108915.0,2013-03-07 20:50:11+00:00,10680180,86,"Judging from the existing answers, there seems to be a lot of confusion about this concept. 
The Problem Is Always a Graph
The distinction between tree search and graph search is not rooted in the fact whether your problem is a tree or a graph. It is always assumed you're dealing with a graph. The distinction lies in the traversal pattern that is used to search through the graph, which can be graph-shaped or tree-shaped.
If you're dealing with a tree-shaped problem, both algorithm variants lead to equivalent results. So you can pick the simpler tree search variant.
Difference Between Graph and Tree Search
Your basic graph search algorithm looks something like the following. With a start node start, directed edges as successors and a goal specification used in the loop condition. open holds the nodes in memory, which are currently under consideration, the open list. Note that the following pseudo code is not correct in every aspect (2).
Tree Search
open <- []
next <- start
while next isn't goal {
  open += successors of next
  next <- select from open
  remove next from open
}
return next

Depending on how you implement select from open, you obtain different variants of search algorithms, like depth-first search (DFS) (pick newest element), breadth first search (BFS) (pick oldest element) or uniform cost search (pick element with lowest path cost), the popular A-star search by choosing the node with lowest cost plus heuristic value, and so on.
The algorithm stated above is actually called tree search. It will visit a state of the underlying problem graph multiple times, if there are multiple directed paths to it rooting in the start state. It is even possible to visit a state an infinite number of times if it lies on a directed loop. But each visit corresponds to a different node in the tree generated by our search algorithm. This apparent inefficiency is sometimes wanted, as explained later.
Graph Search
As we saw, tree search can visit a state multiple times. And as such it will explore the ""sub tree"" found after this state several times, which can be expensive. Graph search fixes this by keeping track of all visited states in a closed list. If a newly found successor to next is already known, it won't be inserted into the open list:
open <- []
closed <- []
next <- start
while next isn't goal {
  closed += next
  open += successors of next, which are not in closed
  next <- select from open
  remove next from open
}
return next

Comparison
We notice that graph search requires more memory, as it keeps track of all visited states. This may compensated by the smaller open list, which results in improved search efficiency.
Optimal solutions
Some methods of implementing select can guarantee to return optimal solutions - i.e. a shortest path or a path with minimal cost (for graphs with costs attached to edges). This basically holds whenever nodes are expanded in order of increasing cost, or when the cost is a nonzero positive constant. A common algorithm that implements this kind of select is uniform cost search, or if step costs are identical, BFS or IDDFS. IDDFS avoids BFS's aggressive memory consumption and is generally recommended for uninformed search (aka brute force) when step size is constant.
A*
Also the (very popular) A* tree search algorithm delivers an optimal solution when used with an admissible heuristic. The A* graph search algorithm, however, only makes this guarantee when it used with a consistent (or ""monotonic"") heuristic (a stronger condition than admissibility).
(2) Flaws of pseudo-code
For simplicity, the presented code does not:

GRANT ALL ON *.* to user@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'password'; 

However, note that the documentation indicates that in order for this to work, another user account from localhost must be created for the same user; otherwise, the anonymous account created automatically by mysql_install_db takes precedence because it has a more specific host column. 
In other words; in order for user user to be able to connect from any server; 2 accounts need to be created as follows: 
GRANT ALL ON *.* to user@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 'password'; 
GRANT ALL ON *.* to user@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'password'; 

Read the full documentation here.
And here's the relevant piece for reference:

After connecting to the server as root, you can add new accounts. The
  following statements use GRANT to set up four new accounts:

mysql> CREATE USER 'monty'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'some_pass';
mysql> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'monty'@'localhost'
    ->     WITH GRANT OPTION;
mysql> CREATE USER 'monty'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'some_pass';
mysql> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'monty'@'%'
    ->     WITH GRANT OPTION;
mysql> CREATE USER 'admin'@'localhost';
mysql> GRANT RELOAD,PROCESS ON *.* TO 'admin'@'localhost';
mysql> CREATE USER 'dummy'@'localhost';


The accounts created by these statements have the following
  properties:
Two of the accounts have a user name of monty and a password of
  some_pass. Both accounts are superuser accounts with full privileges
  to do anything. The 'monty'@'localhost' account can be used only when
  connecting from the local host. The 'monty'@'%' account uses the '%'
  wildcard for the host part, so it can be used to connect from any
  host.
It is necessary to have both accounts for monty to be able to connect
  from anywhere as monty. Without the localhost account, the
  anonymous-user account for localhost that is created by
  mysql_install_db would take precedence when monty connects from the
  local host. As a result, monty would be treated as an anonymous user.
  The reason for this is that the anonymous-user account has a more
  specific Host column value than the 'monty'@'%' account and thus comes
  earlier in the user table sort order. (user table sorting is discussed
  in Section 6.2.4, âAccess Control, Stage 1: Connection Verificationâ.)

That seems silly to me unless I am misunderstanding this.

In the same line as LINQ to SQL, Entity Framework, LLBLGen, and others, ORM tools remove most of the need to write stored procedures to handle common data access (CRUD) for your business objects. ORM tools require that you create (either manually or with a visual designer...depends on the one you choose) a mapping specification that traces which properties of your objects map to which columns of your tables and/or views in your database. When you need to retrieve objects, the ORM tool generates the appropriate SQL for you, and sends it to the database. When the time comes to update your objects, the ORM will not only create the SQL to insert, update, and delete for you...it will also batch those commands so that a single connection and batch of commands are sent to the database and performs the whole thing in a transaction. ORM tools can also improve the efficiency of your queries by allowing you to select entire object graphs in a single go, generating the most efficient SQL for the task.
With ORM tools, you still need to query, however you either with basic methods on the ORM's context or session object, or with a custom query language for that ORM. These days, most ORM's, including NHibernate, also provide LINQ support, allowing you to use standard LINQ syntax to query your object model, which in turn is translated to SQL queries against your database for you.
The benefit of OR mappers is that you centralize almost ALL of your code into your domain, rather than splitting it between domain and stored procs. You lighten the stored procedure load on your database, providing less of a barrier to refactoring your database if the need ever arises, providing greater business agility not only in your domain, but also with your database schema. Since you don't have to write SQL, and especially if you use LINQ, you can often create a more efficient application in less effort with lower long term maintenance costs.
Aside from the inevitable war with your DBA's (if you have them), OR mappers can bring considerable benefits to the table that can reduce implementation effort, improve maintainability, and provide greater business agility. 
Hope that answers the question. ;)

I know a way to work around this via a custom template tag, but I was curious if there were other methods I was over looking. I've created a gallery function of sorts for my blog, and I have a gallery list page that paginates all my galleries. Now, I don't want to show all the photos of each gallery in that list, since if each gallery even has 20 images, then that's 100 images on a page if I paginate at 5 posts. That'd be wasteful, and the wrong way to go about things.
The question I have is, is there a way to just display 3 photos from the photo set? What I'd like to do, but I don't think is possible is something like (pseudocode):
{% for photos in gallery.photo_set %}
   {% if forloop.counter lt 3 %}
     <img src=""{{ photos.url }}"">
   {% endif %}
{% endfor %}

Judging from the documentation, unless I'm completely missing it, that's not possible via the templating system. Hence, I can just write my own template tag of sorts to work around it. I could probably do something from the view aspect, but I haven't looked to far into that idea. The other option I have is giving the model a preview field, and allow the user to select the photos they want in the preview field. 
Anyways, a few different options, so I thought I'd poll the audience to see how you'd do it. Any opinion is appreciated. Personally, enjoying that there's numerous ways to skin this cat.

1220118,149076.0,2009-08-02 23:08:04+00:00,1218390,2867,"Your problem with Vim is that  you don't grok vi.
You mention cutting with yy and complain that you almost never want to cut whole lines.  In fact programmers, editing source code, very often want to work on whole lines, ranges of lines and blocks of code.  However, yy is only one of many way to yank text into the anonymous copy buffer (or ""register"" as it's called in vi).
The ""Zen"" of vi is that you're speaking a language.  The initial y is a verb.  The statement yy is a synonym for y_. The y is doubled up to make it easier to type, since it is such a common operation.
This can also be expressed as dd P (delete the current line and paste a copy back into place; leaving a copy in the anonymous register as a side effect).  The y and d ""verbs"" take any movement as their ""subject.""  Thus yW is ""yank from here (the cursor) to the end of the current/next (big) word"" and y'a is ""yank from here to the line containing the mark named 'a'.""
If you only understand basic up, down, left, and right cursor movements then vi will be no more productive than a copy of ""notepad"" for you.  (Okay, you'll still have syntax highlighting and the ability to handle files larger than a piddling ~45KB or so; but work with me here).
vi has 26 ""marks"" and 26 ""registers.""  A mark is set to any cursor location using the m command.  Each mark is designated by a single lower case letter.  Thus ma sets the 'a' mark to the current location, and mz sets the 'z' mark.  You can move to the line containing a mark using the ' (single quote) command.  Thus 'a moves to the beginning of the line containing the 'a' mark.  You can move to the precise location of any mark using the ` (backquote) command.  Thus `z will move directly to the exact location of the 'z' mark.
Because these are ""movements"" they can also be used as subjects for other ""statements.""
So, one way to cut an arbitrary selection of text would be to drop a mark (I usually use 'a' as my ""first"" mark, 'z' as my next mark, 'b' as another, and 'e' as yet another (I don't recall ever having interactively used more than four marks in 15 years of using vi; one creates one's own conventions regarding how marks and registers are used by macros that don't disturb one's interactive context).  Then we go to the other end of our desired text; we can start at either end, it doesn't matter.  Then we can simply use d`a to cut or y`a to copy.  Thus the whole process has a 5 keystrokes overhead (six if we started in ""insert"" mode and needed to Esc out command mode).  Once we've cut or copied then pasting in a copy is a single keystroke: p.
I say that this is one way to cut or copy text.  However, it is only one of many.  Frequently we can more succinctly describe the range of text without moving our cursor around and dropping a mark.  For example if I'm in a paragraph of text I can use { and } movements to the beginning or end of the paragraph respectively.  So, to move a paragraph of text I cut it using { d} (3 keystrokes).  (If I happen to already be on the first or last line of the paragraph I can then simply use d} or d{ respectively.  
The notion of ""paragraph"" defaults to something which is usually intuitively reasonable.  Thus it often works for code as well as prose.
Frequently we know some pattern (regular expression) that marks one end or the other of the text in which we're interested.  Searching forwards or backwards are movements in vi.  Thus they can also be used as ""subjects"" in our ""statements.""  So I can use d/foo to cut from the current line to the next line containing the string ""foo"" and y?bar to copy from the current line to the most recent (previous) line containing ""bar.""  If I don't want whole lines I can still use the search movements (as statements of their own), drop my mark(s) and use the `x commands as described previously.
In addition to ""verbs"" and ""subjects"" vi also has ""objects"" (in the grammatical sense of the term).  So far I've only described the use of the anonymous register.  However, I can use any of the 26 ""named"" registers by prefixing the ""object"" reference with "" (the double quote modifier).  Thus if I use ""add I'm cutting the current line into the 'a' register and if I use ""by/foo then I'm yanking a copy of the text from here to the next line containing ""foo"" into the 'b' register.  To paste from a register I simply prefix the paste with the same modifier sequence: ""ap pastes a copy of the 'a' register's contents into the text after the cursor and ""bP pastes a copy from 'b' to before the current line.
This notion of ""prefixes"" also adds the analogs of grammatical ""adjectives"" and ""adverbs'  to our text manipulation ""language.""  Most commands (verbs) and movement (verbs or objects, depending on context) can also take numeric prefixes. Thus 3J means ""join the next three lines"" and d5} means ""delete from the current line through the end of the fifth paragraph down from here.""
This is all intermediate level vi.  None of it is Vim specific and there are far more advanced tricks in vi if you're ready to learn them.  If you were to master just these intermediate concepts then you'd probably find that you rarely need to write any macros because the text manipulation language is sufficiently concise and expressive to do most things easily enough using the editor's ""native"" language.

A sampling of more advanced tricks:
There are a number of : commands, most notably the :% s/foo/bar/g global substitution technique.  (That's not advanced but other : commands can be).  The whole : set of commands was historically inherited by vi's previous incarnations as the ed (line editor) and later the ex (extended line editor) utilities.  In fact vi is so named because it's the visual interface to ex.
: commands normally operate over lines of text.  ed and ex were written in an era when terminal screens were uncommon and many terminals were ""teletype"" (TTY) devices.  So it was common to work from printed copies of the text, using commands through an extremely terse interface (common connection speeds were 110 baud, or, roughly, 11 characters per second -- which is slower than a fast typist; lags were common on multi-user interactive sessions; additionally there was often some motivation to conserve paper).
So the syntax of most : commands includes an address or range of addresses (line number) followed by a command.  Naturally one could use literal line numbers: :127,215 s/foo/bar to change the first occurrence of ""foo"" into ""bar"" on each line between 127 and 215.  One could also use some abbreviations such as . or $ for current and last lines respectively.  One could also use relative prefixes + and - to refer to offsets after or before the curent line, respectively.  Thus: :.,$j meaning ""from the current line to the last line, join them all into one line"".  :% is synonymous with :1,$ (all the lines).
The :... g and :... v commands bear some explanation as they are incredibly powerful.  :... g is a prefix for ""globally"" applying a subsequent command to all lines which match a pattern (regular expression) while :... v applies such a command to all lines which do NOT match the given pattern (""v"" from ""conVerse"").  As with other ex commands these can be prefixed by addressing/range references.  Thus :.,+21g/foo/d means ""delete any lines containing the string ""foo"" from the current one through the next 21 lines"" while :.,$v/bar/d means ""from here to the end of the file, delete any lines which DON'T contain the string ""bar.""
It's interesting that the common Unix command grep was actually inspired by this ex command (and is named after the way in which it was documented).  The ex command :g/re/p (grep) was the way they documented how to ""globally"" ""print"" lines containing a ""regular expression"" (re).  When ed and ex were used, the :p command was one of the first that anyone learned and often the first one used when editing any file.  It was how you printed the current contents (usually just one page full at a time using :.,+25p or some such).
Note that :% g/.../d or (its reVerse/conVerse counterpart: :% v/.../d are the most common usage patterns.  However there are  couple of other ex commands which are worth remembering:
We can use m to move lines around, and j to join lines.  For example if you have a list and you want to separate all the stuff matching (or conversely NOT matching some pattern) without deleting them, then you can use something like: :% g/foo/m$ ... and all the ""foo"" lines will have been moved to the end of the file.  (Note the other tip about using the end of your file as a scratch space).  This will have preserved the relative order of all the ""foo"" lines while having extracted them from the rest of the list.  (This would be equivalent to doing something like: 1G!GGmap!Ggrep foo<ENTER>1G:1,'a g/foo'/d (copy the file to its own tail, filter the tail through grep, and delete all the stuff from the head).
To join lines usually I can find a pattern for all the lines which need to be joined to their predecessor (all the lines which start with ""^   "" rather than ""^ * "" in some bullet list, for example).  For that case I'd use: :% g/^   /-1j (for every matching line, go up one line and join them). (BTW: for bullet lists trying to search for the bullet lines and join to the next doesn't work for a couple reasons ... it can join one bullet line to another, and it won't join any bullet line to all of its continuations; it'll only work pairwise on the matches).
Almost needless to mention you can use our old friend s (substitute) with the g and v (global/converse-global) commands.  Usually you don't need to do so.  However, consider some case where you want to perform a substitution only on lines matching some other pattern.  Often you can use a complicated pattern with captures and use back references to preserve the portions of the lines that you DON'T want to change.  However, it will often be easier to separate the match from the substitution: :% g/foo/s/bar/zzz/g -- for every line containing ""foo"" substitute all ""bar"" with ""zzz.""  (Something like :% s/\(.*foo.*\)bar\(.*\)/\1zzz\2/g would only work for the cases those instances of ""bar"" which were PRECEDED by ""foo"" on the same line; it's ungainly enough already, and would have to be mangled further to catch all the cases where ""bar"" preceded ""foo"")
The point is that there are more than just p, s, and d lines in the ex command set. 
The : addresses can also refer to marks.  Thus you can use: :'a,'bg/foo/j to join any line containing the string foo to its subsequent line, if it lies between the lines between the 'a' and 'b' marks.  (Yes, all of the preceding ex command examples can be limited to subsets of the file's lines by prefixing with these sorts of addressing expressions).
That's pretty obscure (I've only used something like that a few times in the last 15 years). However, I'll freely admit that I've often done things iteratively and interactively that could probably have been done more efficiently if I'd taken the time to think out the correct incantation.
Another very useful vi or ex command is :r to read in the contents of another file.  Thus: :r foo inserts the contents of the file named ""foo"" at the current line.  
More powerful is the :r! command.  This reads the results of a command.  It's the same as suspending the vi session, running a command, redirecting its output to a temporary file, resuming your vi session, and reading in the contents from the temp. file.
Even more powerful are the ! (bang) and :... ! (ex bang) commands.  These also execute external commands and read the results into the current text. However, they also filter selections of our text through the command!  This we can sort all the lines in our file using 1G!Gsort (G is the vi ""goto"" command; it defaults to going to the last line of the file, but can be prefixed by a line number, such as 1, the first line).  This is equivalent to the ex variant :1,$!sort.  Writers often use ! with the Unix fmt or fold utilities for reformating or ""word wrapping"" selections of text.  A very common macro is {!}fmt (reformat the current paragraph).  Programmers sometimes use it to run their code, or just portions of it, through indent or other code reformatting tools.
Using the :r! and ! commands means that any external utility or filter can be treated as an extension of our editor.  I have occasionally used these with scripts that pulled data from a database, or with wget or lynx commands that pulled data off a website, or ssh commands that pulled data from remote systems.
Another useful ex command is :so (short for :source).  This reads the contents of a file as a series of commands.  When you start vi it normally, implicitly, performs a :source on ~/.exinitrc file (and Vim usually does this on ~/.vimrc, naturally enough).  The use of this is that you can change your editor profile on the fly by simply sourcing in a new set of macros, abbreviations, and editor settings.  If you're sneaky you can even use this as a trick for storing sequences of ex editing commands to apply to files on demand.
For example I have a seven line file (36 characters) which runs a file through wc, and inserts a C-style comment at the top of the file containing that word count data.  I can apply that ""macro"" to a file by using a command like: vim +'so mymacro.ex' ./mytarget
(The + command line option to vi and Vim is normally used to start the editing session at a given line number.  However it's a little known fact that one can follow the + by any valid ex command/expression, such as a ""source"" command as I've done here; for a simple example I have scripts which invoke: vi +'/foo/d|wq!' ~/.ssh/known_hosts to remove an entry from my SSH known hosts file non-interactively while I'm re-imaging a set of servers).
Usually it's far easier to write such ""macros"" using Perl, AWK, sed (which is, in fact, like grep a utility inspired by the ed command).
The @ command is probably the most obscure vi command.  In occasionally teaching advanced systems administration courses for close to a decade I've met very few people who've ever used it.  @ executes the contents of a register as if it were a vi or ex command.
Example: I often use: :r!locate ... to find some file on my system and read its name into my document.  From there I delete any extraneous hits, leaving only the full path to the file I'm interested in.  Rather than laboriously Tab-ing through each component of the path (or worse, if I happen to be stuck on a machine without Tab completion support in its copy of vi) I just use:

0i:r (to turn the current line into a valid :r command),
""cdd (to delete the line into the ""c"" register) and
@c execute that command.

That's only 10 keystrokes (and the expression ""cdd @c is effectively a finger macro for me, so I can type it almost as quickly as any common six letter word).

A sobering thought
I've only scratched to surface of vi's power and none of what I've described here is even part of the ""improvements"" for which vim is named!  All of what I've described here should work on any old copy of vi from 20 or 30 years ago.
There are people who have used considerably more of vi's power than I ever will.

It really seems you should be (as a developer) faster with Vim than with any other editor.
I'm using Vim to do some basic stuff and I'm at best 10 times less productive with Vim.
The only two things you should care about when you talk about speed (you may not care enough about them, but you should) are:

Using alternatively left and right
hands is the fastest way to use the
keyboard. 
Never touching the mouse is the
second way to be as fast as possible.
It takes ages for you to move your hand,
grab the mouse, move it, and bring it
back to the keyboard (and you often have
to look at the keyboard to be sure you
returned your hand properly to the right place)

Here are two examples demonstrating why I'm far less productive with Vim.
Copy/Cut & paste. I do it all the time. With all the contemporary editors you press Shift  with the left hand, and you move the cursor with your right hand to select text. Then Ctrl+C copies, you move the cursor and Ctrl+V pastes.
With Vim it's horrible:

yy to copy one line (you almost never want the whole line!)
[number xx]yy to copy xx lines into the buffer. But you never know exactly if you've selected what you wanted. I often have to do [number xx]dd then u to undo!

Another example? Search & replace.

In PSPad: Ctrl+f then type what you want you search for, then press Enter.
In Vim: /, then type what you want to search for, then if there are some special characters put \ before each special character, then press Enter.

And everything with Vim is like that: it seems I don't know how to handle it the right way.
NB : I've already read the Vim cheat sheet :)
My question is:
What is the way you use Vim that makes you more productive than with a contemporary editor?

So, personally, I agree with mention what use WeakReference in listeners lists is more like a hack whan a solution. It's pattern worth to know about, sometimes it can help you -- to make legacy code work well, for example. But it is not pattern of choice :) 
P.S. Also it should be noted what WeakReference introduce aditional level of indirection, which, in some cases with extremely high event rates, can reduce performance.

The big 'Pro' of course is that:
Adding a listener as a WeakReference means the listener doesnt need to bother 'removing' itself.
Update
For those worried about the listener having the only reference to the object, why cant there be 2 methods, addListener() and addWeakRefListener()? 
those who dont care about removal can use the latter.

28916684,211563.0,2015-03-07 15:49:23+00:00,2698460,101,"First, note that this behavior applies to any default value that is subsequently mutated (e.g. hashes and strings), not just arrays.
TL;DR: Use Hash.new { |h, k| h[k] = [] } if you want the simplest, most idiomatic solution.

What doesnât work
Why Hash.new([]) doesnât work
Letâs look more in-depth at why Hash.new([]) doesnât work:
h = Hash.new([])
h[0] << 'a'  #=> [""a""]
h[1] << 'b'  #=> [""a"", ""b""]
h[1]         #=> [""a"", ""b""]

h[0].object_id == h[1].object_id  #=> true
h  #=> {}

We can see that our default object is being reused and mutated (this is because it is passed as the one and only default value, the hash has no way of getting a fresh, new default value), but why are there no keys or values in the array, despite h[1] still giving us a value? Hereâs a hint:
h[42]  #=> [""a"", ""b""]

The array returned by each [] call is just the default value, which weâve been mutating all this time so now contains our new values. Since << doesnât assign to the hash (there can never be assignment in Ruby without an = presentâ ), weâve never put anything into our actual hash. Instead we have to use <<= (which is to << as += is to +):
h[2] <<= 'c'  #=> [""a"", ""b"", ""c""]
h             #=> {2=>[""a"", ""b"", ""c""]}

This is the same as:
h[2] = (h[2] << 'c')

Why Hash.new { [] } doesnât work
Using Hash.new { [] } solves the problem of reusing and mutating the original default value (as the block given is called each time, returning a new array), but not the assignment problem:
h = Hash.new { [] }
h[0] << 'a'   #=> [""a""]
h[1] <<= 'b'  #=> [""b""]
h             #=> {1=>[""b""]}


What does work
The assignment way
If we remember to always use <<=, then Hash.new { [] } is a viable solution, but itâs a bit odd and non-idiomatic (Iâve never seen <<= used in the wild). Itâs also prone to subtle bugs if << is inadvertently used.
The mutable way
The documentation for Hash.new states (emphasis my own):

If a block is specified, it will be called with the hash object and the key, and should return the default value. It is the blockâs responsibility to store the value in the hash if required.

So we must store the default value in the hash from within the block if we wish to use << instead of <<=:
h = Hash.new { |h, k| h[k] = [] }
h[0] << 'a'  #=> [""a""]
h[1] << 'b'  #=> [""b""]
h            #=> {0=>[""a""], 1=>[""b""]}

This effectively moves the assignment from our individual calls (which would use <<=) to the block passed to Hash.new, removing the burden of unexpected behavior when using <<.
Note that there is one functional difference between this method and the others: this way assigns the default value upon reading (as the assignment always happens inside the block). For example:
h1 = Hash.new { |h, k| h[k] = [] }
h1[:x]
h1  #=> {:x=>[]}

h2 = Hash.new { [] }
h2[:x]
h2  #=> {}

The immutable way
You may be wondering why Hash.new([]) doesnât work while Hash.new(0) works just fine. The key is that Numerics in Ruby are immutable, so we naturally never end up mutating them in-place. If we treated our default value as immutable, we could use Hash.new([]) just fine too:
h = Hash.new([].freeze)
h[0] += ['a']  #=> [""a""]
h[1] += ['b']  #=> [""b""]
h[2]           #=> []
h              #=> {0=>[""a""], 1=>[""b""]}

Of all the ways, I personally prefer this wayâimmutability generally makes reasoning about things much simpler (this is, after all, the only method that has no possibility of hidden or subtle unexpected behavior).

â  This isnât strictly true, methods like instance_variable_set bypass this, but they must exist for metaprogramming since the l-value in = cannot be dynamic.
",2698460,430254.0,2010-04-23 12:32:45+00:00,,63,"Strange, unexpected behavior (disappearing/changing values) when using Hash default value, e.g. Hash.new([])","Consider this code:
h = Hash.new(0)  # New hash pairs will by default have 0 as values
h[1] += 1  #=> {1=>1}
h[2] += 2  #=> {2=>2}

Thatâs all fine, but:
h = Hash.new([])  # Empty array as default value
h[1] <<= 1  #=> {1=>[1]}                  â Ok
h[2] <<= 2  #=> {1=>[1,2], 2=>[1,2]}      â Why did `1` change?
h[3] << 3   #=> {1=>[1,2,3], 2=>[1,2,3]}  â Where is `3`?

At this point I expect the hash to be:
{1=>[1], 2=>[2], 3=>[3]}

but itâs far from that. What is happening and how can I get the behavior I expect?

A monad basically means that you encapsulate values into a container and have some functions to chain functions from values to values inside a container. If our container has the type:
data IO a = IO (RealWorld -> (a,RealWorld))

we can safely implement IO actions. This type means: An action of type IO is a function, that takes a token of type RealWorld and returns a new token, together with a result.
The idea behind this is that each IO action mutates the outside state, represented by the magical token RealWorld. Using monads, one can chain multiple functions that mutate the real world together. The most important function of a monad is >>=, pronounced bind:
(>>=) :: IO a -> (a -> IO b) -> IO b

>>= takes one action and a function that takes the result of this action and creates a new action out of this. The return type is the new action. For instance, let's pretend there is a function now :: IO String, which returns a String representing the current time. We can chain it with the function putStrLn to print it out:
now >>= putStrLn

Or written in do-Notation, which is more familiar to an imperative programmer:
do currTime <- now
   putStrLn currTime

All this is pure, as we map the mutation and information about the world outside to the RealWorld token. So each time, you run this action, you get of course a different output, but the input is not the same: the RealWorld token is different.

I read about it from here and there, and so came to know that in functional programming, a function returns the same output, for same input, no matter how many times the function is called.  It's exactly like mathematical function which evaluates to same output for same value of input parameter which involves in the function expression. 
For example, consider this:
f(x,y) = x*x + y; //it is a mathematical function

No matter how many times you use f(10,4), its value will always be 104. As such, wherever you've written f(10,4), you can replace it with 104, without altering the value of the whole expression. This property is referred to as referential transparency of an expression.
As Wikipedia says (link),

Conversely, in functional code, the output value of a function depends only on the arguments that are input to the function, so calling a function f twice with the same value for an argument x will produce the same result f(x) both times. 

So my question is: can a time function (which returns the current time) exist in functional programming? 

If yes, then how can it exist? Does it not violate the principle of functional programming? It particularly violates referential transparency which is one of the property of functional programming (if I correctly understand it).
Or if no, then how can one know the current time in functional programming?

.htpasswd does not provide much security by itself. That is, it provides a login mechanism, and Apache will not respond without the proper credentials, but unless separately configured, nothing about the exchange is encrypted (or even obfuscated). For example, listening to the GET request with Wireshark gives you a nice view of all the headers being sent by the client, including:
Authorization: Basic d3BhbG1lcjp0ZXN0dGVzdA==

""d3BhbG1lcjp0ZXN0dGVzdA=="" being just the base64 encoded form of ""wpalmer:testtest"". These days, a hacker (or more likely, a virus) can sit on a public WiFi connection and log any requests containing the Authorization: for later perusal. In general, sending any authentication information over an unencrypted HTTP connection is considered a bad idea, even if you're over a wire or secure WiFi end-to-end. It would not, for example, meet the requirements of PCI Compliance if you were storing customer data, payment information, etc behind the .htpasswd lock.
Add https to the mix, and you completely eliminate that particular problem, however...
.htpasswd authentication as implemented by Apache httpd does not provide any form of rate-limiting or brute-force protection. You can make as many simultaneous attempts at a password guess as Apache is willing to serve simultaneous pages, and Apache will respond with success/failure as soon as it possibly can. You can use something like Fail2Ban to limit the number of failed attempts can be made before the client is blocked from talking to the server, but that will not necessarily provide any useful protection against a botnet, which may automatically target your server from thousands of unique addresses. This can lead to the decision of ""do I leave myself vulnerable to password attempts from botnets, or do I leave myself vulnerable to denial-of-service attacks, when the entire account is locked-down due to failures from multiple clients?""
These angles of attack can be limited by adding IP-based restrictions to your .htaccess file, allowing connections only from certain addresses. Depending on how you operate, this may be inconvenient, but it also severely limits the types of threats which you would be vulnerable to. You would still be at risk from someone specifically targeting your site, or an infection on part of the network infrastructure itself. Depending on the type of content you are protecting, this may be ""good enough"". An example of this type of restriction is:
Order deny,allow
Deny from all
Allow from 127.0.0.1

This means, in short, ""only allow connections from the local host"". Line-by-line, it means:

Order deny,allow defines the order in which rules are processed, with the last match taking precedence.
Deny from all begin by assuming that all clients are denied
Allow from 127.0.0.1 if the client has the IP 127.0.0.1, then it is allowed

To some extent, IP-based restrictions will also protect you to the point where HTTPS may be considered optional. Attackers / viruses can still see your credentials, but it is harder for them to use those credentials on the page itself. Again, this would not be PCI compliant, and it would not be suitable for ""important"" information, but there are some situations for which this may be considered ""good enough"". Be aware that many people re-use credentials across multiple sites, so failing to protect login details is generally considered to be very dangerous to the user, even if the site itself is protected.
Finally, the .htaccess file itself is a bit of a liability. See the response to ""do they need to be outside the public directory?"" for more details on that.
Can it be bypassed easily?
No. There is no reason to expect that the server, when properly configured, would ever fail to require login details to access the protected content. While HTTP Basic authentication has its flaws, Apache httpd is very robust and is one of the most thoroughly tested pieces of software in the world. If you tell Apache that HTTP Basic authentication is required to access certain content, it will be required.
If Apache by default does not allow users to access either of the two files directly, do they need to be outside the public directory?
There are a couple of points to this. First, Apache does not default to preventing access to either of these files. Many distributions of Apache httpd include initial configuration which prevents access (using ""Deny from all"" rules) to, depending on the distribution, .htaccess/.htpasswd files, .ht* files, or .* files. It is very common, but there are plenty of reasons why this may not be the case. You can add a rule yourself to block these files, if they are not already blocked:
<FilesMatch ""^.(htaccess|htpasswd)$"">
    Order Allow,Deny
    Deny from all
</FilesMatch>

Secondly, it should be pointed out that the way .htaccess files work, they are processed when the directory they are in is matched. That is to say: .htpasswd may be elsewhere, but .htaccess needs to be in the same directory. That said, see the ""speed implications"" section for a bit more detail.
So, as they can be blocked so easily, why keep .htpasswd outside of the public directory? Because mistakes happen, and the .htpasswd file is a big liability. Even if you're using HTTPS, exposure of your .htpasswd file means that your passwords can be easily cracked via brute-force attacks. These days, consumer-grade GPUs can make millions of password guesses per second. This can make even ""strong"" passwords fall in comparatively little time. Again, this argument generally only applies to a targeted attack, but the fact remains that if an attacker has your .htpasswd file and wants access to your system, these days, they may be able to do so easily. See Speed Hashing on Coding Horror for a relatively-recent (April 2012) overview of the state of things.
With that in mind, the possibility of accidentally (temporarily) exposing your .htaccess file is worth moving it somewhere that should never be even looked at when httpd is looking for content to serve. Yes, there are still configuration changes which could expose it if it's ""one level up"" instead of ""in the public directory"", but those changes are much less likely to happen accidentally.
Are there any speed implications?
Some.
First off, the use of .htaccess files does slow down things somewhat. More specifically, the AllowOverride all directive causes a lot of potential slow-down. This causes Apache to look for .htaccess files in every directory, and every parent of a directory, that is accessed (up to and including the DocumentRoot). This means querying the filesystem for a file (or updates to the file), for every request. Compared to the alternative of potentially never hitting the filesystem, this is quite a difference.
So, why does .htaccess exist at all? There are many reasons which might make it ""worth it"":

depending on your server load, you may never notice the difference. Does your server really need to squeeze every last millisecond out of every request? If not, then don't worry about it. As always, don't worry about estimates and projections. Profile your real-world situations and see if it makes a difference.
.htaccess can be modified without restarting the server. In fact, this is what makes it so slow- Apache checks for changes or the presence of an .htaccess file on every request, so changes are applied immediately.
An error in .htaccess will take down the directory, not the server. This makes it much less of a liability than changing the httpd.conf file.
.htaccess can be modified even if you only have write-access to a single directory. This makes it ideal for shared hosting environments. No need to have access to httpd.conf at all, or access to restart the server.
.htaccess can keep the rules for access next to the files they are meant to effect. This can make them a lot easier to find, and just keeps things more-organised.

Don't want to use .htaccess, even considering all of the above? Any rule that applies to .htaccess can be added directly to httpd.conf or an included file.
What about .htpasswd? That depends on how many users you have. It is file-based, and the bare minimum in terms of implementation. From The docs for httpd 2.2:

Because of the way that Basic authentication is specified, your
  username and password must be verified every time you request a
  document from the server. This is even if you're reloading the same
  page, and for every image on the page (if they come from a protected
  directory). As you can imagine, this slows things down a little. The
  amount that it slows things down is proportional to the size of the
  password file, because it has to open up that file, and go down the
  list of users until it gets to your name. And it has to do this every
  time a page is loaded.
A consequence of this is that there's a practical limit to how many
  users you can put in one password file. This limit will vary depending
  on the performance of your particular server machine, but you can
  expect to see slowdowns once you get above a few hundred entries, and
  may wish to consider a different authentication method at that time.

In short, .htpasswd is slow. If you only have a handful of users who need to authenticate, you'll never notice, but it is yet another consideration.
Summary
Securing an admin section with .htpasswd is not ideal for all situations. Given its simplicity, it may be worth the risks and problems where security and performance are not the highest of priorities. For many situations, with a little bit of tweaking, it can be considered to be ""good enough"". What constitutes ""good enough"" is a judgement call for you to make.

AuthName ""Login title""
AuthType Basic
AuthUserFile /path/to/.htpasswd
require valid-user

.htpasswd (created using htpasswd -c <file> <username> command)
username:encrypted-version-of-password

I am also curious as to the actual level of security this provides: can it be bypassed easily? If Apache by default does not allow users to access either of the two files directly, do they need to be outside the public directory? Are there any speed implications?

let shuffled = GKRandomSource.sharedRandom().arrayByShufflingObjectsInArray(array)

let shuffled = lcg.arrayByShufflingObjectsInArray(array)

2143752,127183.0,2010-01-27 00:28:36+00:00,2143240,68,"Mind that these commands exist since the early days of OpenGL. glFlush ensures that previous OpenGL commands must complete in finite time (OpenGL 2.1 specs, page 245). If you draw directly to the front buffer, this shall ensure that the OpenGL drivers starts drawing without too much delay. You could think of a complex scene that appears object after object on the screen, when you call glFlush after each object. However, when using double buffering, glFlush has practically no effect at all, since the changes won't be visible until you swap the buffers. 
glFinish does not return until all effects from prviously issued commands [...] are fully realized. This means that the execution of your program waits here until every last pixel is drawn and OpenGL has nothing more to do. If you render directly to the front buffer, glFinish is the call to make before using the operating system calls to take screenshots. It is far less useful for double buffering, because you don't see the changes you forced to complete.
So if you use double buffering, you probably won't need neither glFlush nor glFinish. SwapBuffers implicitly directs the OpenGL calls to the correct buffer, there's no need to call glFlush first. And don't mind stressing the OpenGL driver: glFlush will not choke on too many commands. It is not guaranteed that this call returns immediately (whatever that means), so it can take any time it needs to process your commands.
",2143240,242641.0,2010-01-26 22:41:16+00:00,,76,opengl: glFlush() vs. glFinish(),"I'm having trouble distinguishing the practical difference between calling glFlush() and glFinish().
The docs say that glFlush() and glFinish() will push all buffered operations to opengl so that one can be assured they will all be executed, the difference being that glFlush() returns immediately where as glFinish() blocks until all the operations are complete.
Having read the definitions, I figured that if I were to use glFlush() that I would probably run into the problem of submitting more operations to openGL than it could execute. So, just to try, I swapped out my glFinish() for a glFlush() and lo and behold, my program ran (as far as I could tell), the exact same; frame rates, resource usage, everything was the same.
So I'm wondering if there's much difference between the two calls, or if my code makes them run no different. Or where one should be used vs. the other.
I also figured that openGL would have some call like glIsDone() to check whether or not all the buffered commands for a glFlush() are complete or not (so one doesn't send operations to openGL faster than they can be executed), but I could find no such function.
My code is the typical game loop:
while (running) {
    process_stuff();
    render_stuff();
}

For participating users the project shows a ""lock"" icon. So there are obviously private repositories, i just don't know how set one up.

1618867,187690.0,2009-10-24 19:41:36+00:00,1613230,82,"C language (as well as C++) is historically a mix of two completely different programming styles, which one can refer to as ""statement programming"" and ""expression programming"". As you know, every procedural programming language normally supports such fundamental constructs as sequencing and branching. These fundamental constructs are present in C/C++ languages in two forms: one for statement programming, another for expression programming.
For example, when you write your program in terms of statements, you might use a sequence of statements separated by ;. When you want to do some branching, you use if statements. You can also use cycles and other kinds of control transfer statements.
In expression programming the same constructs are available to you as well. This is actually where , operator comes into play. Operator , in nothing else than a separator of sequential expressions in C, i.e. operator , in expression programming serves the same role as ; does in statement programming. Branching in expression programming is done through ?: operator and, alternatively, through short-circuit evaluation properties of && and || operators. (Expression programming has no cycles though. And to replace them with recursion you'd have to apply statement programming.)
For example, the following code
a = rand();
++a;
b = rand();
c = a + b / 2;
if (a < c - 5)
  d = a;
else
  d = b;

which is an example of traditional statement programming, can be re-written in terms of expression programming as
a = rand(), ++a, b = rand(), c = a + b / 2, a < c - 5 ? d = a : d = b;

or as 
a = rand(), ++a, b = rand(), c = a + b / 2, d = a < c - 5 ? a : b;

or
d = (a = rand(), ++a, b = rand(), c = a + b / 2, a < c - 5 ? a : b);

or
a = rand(), ++a, b = rand(), c = a + b / 2, (a < c - 5 && (d = a, 1)) || (d = b);

Needless to say, in practice statement programming usually produces much more readable C/C++ code, so we normally use expression programming in very well measured and restricted amounts. But in many cases it comes handy. And the line between what is acceptable and what is not is to a large degree a matter of personal preference and the ability to recognize and read established idioms.
As an additional note: the very design of the language is obviously tailored towards statements. Statements can freely invoke expressions, but expressions can't invoke statements (aside from calling pre-defined functions). This situation is changed in a rather interesting way in GCC compiler, which supports so called ""statement expressions"" as an extension (symmetrical to ""expression statements"" in standard C). ""Statement expressions"" allow user to directly insert statement-based code into expressions, just like they can insert expression-based code into statements in standard C.
As another additional note: in C++ language functor-based programming plays an important role, which can be seen as another form of ""expression programming"". According to the current trends in C++ design, it might be considered preferable over traditional statement programming in many situations.
